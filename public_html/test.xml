Market to 2025 - Featuring Apollo Radiators, Saint Lawrence &amp; Stelrad Among Others" border="0" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dublin, Oct. 22, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The &amp;quot;Global Towel Warmer Market - Forecasts from 2020 to 2025&amp;quot; report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com&amp;#39;s offering.     The global towel warmer market is evaluated at US$554.678 million for the year 2019 growing at a CAGR of 6.42% reaching the market size of US$805.717 million by the year 2025.     Towel warmers or towel radiators are is a heated towel rail that is designed in such a manner to give a decorative look to the bathroom and has a major function to warm the towels that are hanged on them. These devices are suitable to warm as well as drying the towels along with giving a cozy temperature to the environment of the bathroom. The market for towel warmers is expected to show a decent growth throughout the course of the next five years owing to the fact that the rapid urbanization and growing middle-class population in the emerging economies of the globe has led to an upsurge in the residential construction. Furthermore, the growing house remodeling in many parts of the world and an upsurge in the adoption of modern housing infrastructure is further widening up the business growth opportunities for the manufacturers over the next five years. There has been an increasing focus of the people towards hygiene and health as wet towels possess a number of germs. This, in turn, is also positively impacting the demand for towel warmers for residential applications, thereby playing a significant role in shaping up the market growth over the next five years.    Global towel warmer market has been segmented based on type. By type, the market is segmented as the electric and hydronic. By the application, the segmentation is done on the basis residential and commercial. By distribution channel, the market is segmented into online and offline. Geographically, the segmentation of the market has been distributed into North America, South America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific.    Electric towel warmer to hold a significant share    Towel warmers come in two types namely electric and hydronic. Both types of towel warmers have the same function which is either to dry or heat the towel. But the difference comes in their methods of heating. Electric towel warmers or tower rails are connected with electricity and is simply connected to the power outlet in the respective place where it is installed. The electric tower warmer type is projected to hold a major market share and is expected to stay dominant throughout the course of the next five years. The primary factor supplementing the significant share of this segment includes the booming acceptance of electric towel warmers across the commercial sector owing to the fact that a majority of commercial spaces lack sufficient space for central heating systems which further leads to an increased demand for electric systems, this, in turn, is positively impacting the growth of this segment during the next five years.     Moreover, the market players are also participating in the form of R&amp;D investments and the launch of new products which further shows the potential for the market to witness a considerable growth over the course of the next five years. For example, in October 2018, WarmlyYours, one of the leaders in heating systems based out of the United States of America announced the launch of a new range of electric towel warmers, i.e., the cosmopolitan collection. The company aimed to tap the growing consumer needs regarding new residential units as well as for remodeling purposes as it launched the range with a range of unique variants and models with different shapes, sizes, and materials suiting every individual&amp;#39;s needs.    However, on the other hand, the hydroponic segment is anticipated to show a notable growth throughout the course of the next five years. Hydroponic towel warmers are connected with the central heating systems. There is a growing adoption of hydroponic towel radiators especially across the residential sector primarily due to the fact that in the developed economies a majority of the residential buildings are equipped with central heating systems. Thus, the installation of these types of warmers in residential buildings further does not add up to its operational costs as well. This, in turn, is positively impacting the growth of this segment throughout the forecast period. Additionally, these types of warmers further act as energy-efficient devices as they do not consume any electricity which further acts as a driving factor for this segment to witness a considerable growth throughout the forecast period.    Residential segment to show healthy growth    The applications of towel warmers are in both residential and commercial spaces. The residential segment is projected to show a promising growth until the end of the forecast period owing to the fact that there has been rapid urbanization in the developing economies of the world such as India and China among others. Furthermore, the growing middle-class population coupled with the improvement in the standards of living of the people is further positively impacting the growth of this segment during the forecast period. Moreover, the growing residential construction in both developed and developing economies along with the increased spending in the remodeling of residential buildings is also one of the key factors supplementing the growth of the residential segment during the next five years. As, with this, the demand for premium and classy bathroom fittings is also increasing, which further provides an impetus to this segment to witness a considerable growth during the next five years.    The figure above represents the total construction spending in the United States which further shows that the residential construction reached US$550,942 million by the year 2019 from US$256,037 million in 2010. Similarly, the non-residential construction reached US$814,195 million by 2019 from US$556,928 million in 2010.    Offline to hold a healthy market share    By the distribution channel, the offline segment is projected to hold a notable share in the market throughout the course of the next five years. The presence of a considerably large population base reluctant towards online shopping of durable products is a key factor bolstering the growth of this segment during the next five years. Furthermore, the presence of a vast number of retail stores further supplements the share of this segment over the forecast period.    However, the online segment is expected to show healthy growth until the end of the forecast period. The booming penetration of the internet and smartphones coupled with the globally growing e-commerce industry has led to the expansion of distribution channels in remote parts of many countries as well. Furthermore, the major players of operating under the market have also moved towards the online distribution of goods on their websites which further shows the potential of the online segment to grow during the next five years.    APAC to show healthy growth    The North American as well as the European regions are anticipated to hold noteworthy shares in the market primarily due to the early adoption of technology coupled with the presence of key players of the market in these regions.

(TSX.V: WGO, OTC: WHGOF, FRA: 29W) (the “Company”) is pleased to announce positive trench, GT probe and soil sample results which identified additional and widespread structurally controlled gold mineralization at multiple targets on its road accessible JP Ross (“JPR”) property. The primary goal of the trenching program was to test identified soil and GT probe geochemistry anomalies and obtain a better understanding of the structural controls on mineralization to aid in drill planning. The positive results from this program in conjunction with other exploration results warranted follow-up exploration, with a series of rotary air blast (RAB) holes recently drilled to further test these targets, and additional RAB and diamond drilling planned for 2021. These activities form an integral part of the Company’s ongoing fully-funded $4 million exploration program backed by strategic partners Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (TSX: AEM, NYSE: AEM) and Kinross Gold Corp (TSX: K, NYSE: KGC), which also includes diamond drilling at the Ryan’s Surprise and Titan targets, RAB drilling at the Hen and JPR properties, and a significant regional program comprising soil and GT probe sampling and ground geophysical (magnetics and VLF-EM) surveys.  Highlights Include:  * Twenty-nine (29) trenches totalling 1,114 linear metres were trenched on 9 separate target areas utilizing an 8-ton tracked excavator. Results expanded known structurally controlled gold mineralization at multiple targets on the road accessible JPR property. Additional targets also to be tested in due course.  * Stage Fright target, trench JPRSF20T009 encountered a high-grade zone grading 8.88 g/t Au over 2.5m, and trench JPRSF20T010 exposed two separate mineralized zones grading 1.06 g/t Au over 2.5m, and 1.83 g/t Au over 2.5m.  * At the Sabotage target, five of seven trenches encountered gold mineralization including 3.40 g/t Au over 1.5m in trench JPRSAB20T023, 1.15 g/t Au over 8.5m in trench JPRSAB20T025, and 1.06 g/t Au over 2.1m and 15.00 g/t Au over 0.8m in trench JPRSAB20T029.  * Trenching on the North Frenzy target traced a north-south striking zone of mineralized quartz vein breccias with anomalous gold over a strike length of 600m.  * GT Probe (top of bedrock) samples on the newly identified and previously untested Notorious target area encountered multiple anomalous gold values ranging from 0.17 g/t Au to 24.4 g/t Au.  * Significant follow-up exploration work was executed pursuant to these findings which included expanded soil geochemistry surveys, a phase 2 trenching program utilizing a CanDig mini-excavator, hand excavated soil pits on existing anomalies and RAB drilling on several high priority targets.  * Virtual Site Tour &amp; Corporate Update Today @ 4PM EST (Details below)  Figures and images to accompany this news release can be found at: http://whitegoldcorp.ca/investors/exploration-highlights/.“We are pleased to have encountered additional gold mineralization across multiple recently identified zones as well as the high-grade gold mineralization on the newly discovered Notorious target, providing further indication that the abundant gold mineralization is part of a robust regional scale structurally controlled system. To date at least 14 gold targets have been identified on the JP Ross property across a 14km by 11km area, many within close proximity to significant current and historical placer gold operations,” stated David D’Onofrio, Chief Executive Officer. “This program has also provided valuable insight into the orientation and geometry of the mineralized systems, information that has been incorporated into our scientific and data driven methodology to define drill targets for the current and future seasons.”REMINDER: Invest Yukon Virtual Site Series Conference Virtual Site Tour Today @ 4PM EST   The Company will be a featured presenter at the Invest Yukon: Virtual Site Series, which will include a corporate overview followed by the premiere of the Company’s virtual site tour hosted by Shawn Ryan (Chief Technical Advisor) and Terry Brace (VP, Exploration). Conference registration details are provided below.Registration &amp; Event Details: https://my.6ix.com/KddB5xMw  Conference Dates: October 20th to 22nd, 2020  White Gold Corp. Presentation Date: October 22nd, 4:00 PM EST (1:00PM PST)JP Ross PropertyThe JPR is a large road accessible property covering 76,385 hectares centered on the famed Henderson Creek placer gold area located north of the Stewart River and east of the Yukon River. The property is located approximately 80km south of Dawson City, and 30km northeast of the Company’s flagship Golden Saddle and Arc deposits which have a mineral resource of 1,139,900 ounces Indicated at 2.28 g/t Au and 402,100 ounces Inferred at 1.39 g/t Au(1). Gold-related alteration and mineralization on the JPR property is predominantly structurally controlled and the area shows a complex structural history. Three primary fault systems are recognized, which from oldest to youngest are: 1) NNW to N-trending thrust faults; 2) WNW to E-W-trending sinistral faults; and 3) NE to NNE-trending sinistral and normal faults. The WNW to E-W-trending sinistral fault systems represent the best potential for orogenic gold, and the younger NE to NNE-trending sinistral and normal faults may potentially host porphyry-style copper-gold mineralization. Multiple gold-in-soil anomalies and target areas have been identified across the property, and recent drilling has confirmed gold mineralization with significant grades and widths, including 5.45 g/t Au over 4.57m in hole JPRNF19RAB-002 at North Frenzy, 5.44 g/t Au over 4.57m in hole JPRSF19RAB-005 at Stage Fright, 3.42 g/t Au over 7.62m in hole JPRSAB19RAB-011 at Sabotage, and 9.61 g/t Au over 4.15m in hole JPRVER19D0005 at Vertigo. Geochemical associations with gold appear to be target specific with mineralization occurring as Au-only, or associated with any combination of Pb, Bi, As, Ag, Cu, Te and Sb. Common accompanying sulphide minerals include pyrite, arsenopyrite and galena.JP Ross Trenching ProgramTwenty-nine (29) trenches totalling 1,114 linear metres were excavated in 9 separate target areas on the JPR property on targets highlighted by 2019 results from soil geochemistry, GT probe samples, VLF surveys, RAB drilling, and geological and structural interpretations. All trench locations were road accessible and were excavated utilizing an 8-ton tracked excavator. Overburden in the project area is thin, and individual trenches generally vary from 1.0m to 2.25m deep (average 1.75m) and from 10m to 100m long. Wherever possible, continuous composite chip samples were collected from each trench with sample lengths typically ranging between 0.5m and 2.5m. The weathered and fractured nature of surficial bedrock in this area precludes high pressure washing and channel sampling as is typical for many trenching programs in Canada.The primary goal of this work was to collect key structural data on mineralized veins, shear zones, faults, etc. which will aid in ongoing detailed interpretations and drill planning. The results have identified additional widespread structurally controlled gold mineralization at multiple targets. Prospective trench results from this program in conjunction with other exploration results, have been followed up with a series of RAB holes to drill test these targets and will be used to define future drill targets.Individual assays for the reported results ranged from trace to 15.0 g/t Au. The most significant results are discussed in more detail below.Supplementary JP Ross Exploration ProgramDuring September, additional exploration work was carried out on the JP Ross property to define and further test a number of additional anomalies and target areas. This work included:  * 835 additional soil samples to follow up on anomalies identified in earlier 2020 soil sampling.  * 88 GT Probe samples on 4 lines.  * 6 small ground magnetics and VLF-EM grids totalling 36.5 line km.  * 40 hand-dug soil pits on strong prospecting rock sample results and soil anomalies (focussing on gold values ranging from 200 ppb to 3,700 ppb Au). The pits were dug until sub-crop was encountered, or to the depth of the original soil sample (up to 1.0m deep). A total of 18 rock samples were collected from the pits for assay.  * 11 CanDig trenches totalling 384m.  * 615m of RAB drilling.Initial GT probe sample results received from the Notorious target area, located approximately 1.5km west of the North Frenzy, are encouraging with multiple samples returning anomalous gold values in the range of 0.17 g/t Au to 24.4 g/t Au. This new target area is located approximately 500m east of the intersection of two interpreted, property-scale sinistral faults, the west-northwest (285°) striking Frenzy Fault and the northeast (065°) striking Fright Fault. The 24.4 g/t Au probe sample was investigated by digging a 1.5m deep hand pit and a series of samples of the rocks encountered at all depths were collected. The deepest samples at 1.4m and 1.5m depths, returned portable XRF readings that are anomalous in tungsten, lead and bismuth, consistent with ICP analytical results received for the probe sample.The results for the additional exploration work programs, to be released in due course, will aid in planning exploration programs for the 2021 season, which is expected to include additional RAB and diamond drilling on several high priority targets.Summary of Trenching ResultsStage FrightThe Stage Fright is located 9.2km NW of Vertigo and covers multiple gold-in-soil anomalies over a 2,700m by 400m NE trend. Three (3) trenches were excavated at Stage Fright where previous CanDig trenching and RAB drilling encountered gold mineralization including 2.31 g/t Au over 16.76m in hole JPRSF19RAB-005. Trench JPRSF20T009 exposed a fracture-controlled oxidized zone in intermediate orthogneiss with narrow quartz and pyrite veinlets, which graded 8.88 g/t Au over 2.5m. Trench JPRSF20T010 cut a potassium feldspar and chlorite altered augen gneiss containing narrow quartz and specular hematite veinlets and exposed two separate mineralized zones grading 1.06 g/t Au over 2.5m and 1.83 g/t over 2.5m.SabotageThe Sabotage target is located approximately 7.5km NW of Vertigo and is comprised of a series of soil anomalies over a 2,100m by 800m NE trend. Seven (7) trenches were excavated at Sabotage with 4 being deeper re-digs of 2019 CanDig trenches that had encountered gold mineralization including 2.69 g/t Au over 10.0m in trench JPRSAB19T016 (see White Gold Corp. News Release dated October 17, 2019 available on SEDAR). Trench JPRSAB20T023 exposed 3 separate zones of gold mineralization including 0.56 g/t Au over 5.0m, 0.87 g/t Au 6.5m and 3.40 g/t Au over 1.5m. The latter mineralization is associated with a geological contact zone between mafic to intermediate gneiss and felsic orthogneiss, characterized by a 5m wide zone of parallel to subparallel quartz veinlets (10-50cm), vugs, oxidation and trace pyrite. Trench JPRSAB20T025 cut felsic orthogneiss with zones of strong sericitization and pervasive silica flooding, with one zone returning 1.15 g/t Au over 8.5m. Trench JPRSAB20T029 exposed felsic orthogneiss with potassic alteration, associated oxidation and hematite, and local strong silica flooding typically bounded by sericitization. Two separate mineralized gold zones graded 1.06 g/t Au over 2.1m and 15.00 g/t Au over 0.8m.North SabotageThe North Sabotage target is located approximately 9.0km NW of Vertigo. Two (2) trenches were excavated at North Sabotage, a 350m by 50m soil anomaly, to test strong gold-in-soil values of up to 760 ppb Au (trench JPRNSAB20T003) and 667 ppb Au (trench JPRNSAB20T004). Trench JPRNSAB20T004 cut strongly sericitized and well foliated felsic orthogneiss with one mineralized zone grading 1.79 g/t Au over 2.5m.VertigoFour (4) trenches were excavated at Vertigo primarily to test a number of interpreted fault structures. Three of the four trenches exposed narrow mineralized oxidized and vuggy quartz veins within felsic to intermediate gneisses including 4.51 g/t Au over 1.5m in JPRVER20T016, 0.91 g/t Au over 2.0m in JPRVER20T017, and 2.78 g/t Au over 1.8m in JPRVER20T018.North FrenzyNorth Frenzy is located 9km N of Vertigo. Four (4) trenches were excavated at North Frenzy where previous CanDig trenching and limited drilling (diamond and RAB drilling) encountered gold mineralization in quartz vein breccias in metaquartzites, associated with a 2km long north-south trending Au-Ag-As-Pb soil anomaly. Trenches JPRNF20T009, JPRNF20T010 and JPRNF20T011 each exposed quartz vein breccias which returned low-grade gold (0.20-0.50 g/t Au) over widths of approximately 2.0m to 10.0m. The zone is open along strike to the north and at depth.Frenzy, X-Man and LifeboatTwo (2) trenches at the Frenzy target located 7.6km N of Vertigo tested gold-in-soil and/or GT probe anomalies. Trench JPRFRE20T006 tested a soil anomaly of up to 357 ppb Au and GT Probe sample results of 0.37 to 1.35 g/t Au, and exposed strongly oxidized micaceous quartzites cut by thin quartz veinlets containing disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite and patchy quartz-sericite alteration. A single mineralized zone returned 0.37 g/t Au over 8.8m.A single trench at the Lifeboat target, located 7.3km NW of Vertigo, JPRLFB20T004 tested a gold-in-soil anomaly of up to 965 ppb Au, and a GT probe anomaly of up to 0.71 g/t Au.Four (4) trenches were excavated at the X-Man target located 12km NE of Vertigo, and based on existing geochemistry results, appears to represent a potential porphyry target. The trenches were primarily testing anomalous gold-in-soil anomalies with values in the range of 122 ppb Au to 319 ppb Au. The trenches exposed tuffaceous volcanic rocks of the Late Cretaceous Carmacks Group containing minor disseminated pyrite and multiple fracture sets. Three of four trenches returned anomalous gold ranging from 0.13 to 0.59 g/t Au over widths ranging from 1.5m to 37.4m.Table 1: Summary of Significant Gold Assay Results, 2020 JP Ross Property TrenchesTarget AreaTrench IDFromToWidth*Gold    (m)(m)(m)(g/t)  Stage FrightJPRSF20T00912.515.02.58.88   JPRSF20T01012.515.02.51.06   JPRSF20T01020.022.52.51.83  SabotageJPRSAB20T0232.57.55.00.56   JPRSAB20T02312.519.06.50.87   JPRSAB20T02338.540.01.53.40   JPRSAB20T0240.05.55.50.11   JPRSAB20T0257.516.08.51.15   inc.7.512.55.01.87   JPRSAB20T02615.822.87.00.25   JPRSAB20T0292.24.32.11.06   inc.2.22.80.63.05   JPRSAB20T02911.111.90.815.00  North Sabotage JPRNSAB20T00413.516.02.51.79  VertigoJPRVER20T01626.128.22.10.30   JPRVER20T01636.037.51.54.51   JPRVER20T01738.740.72.00.91   JPRVER20T0182.24.01.82.78  North FrenzyJPRNFR20T0095.010.55.50.21   JPRNFR20T00914.223.08.80.21   JPRNFR20T00930.532.52.00.44   JPRNFR20T0100.02.52.50.30   JPRNFR20T01030.032.52.50.48   JPRNFR20T0118.010.52.50.40   JPRNFR20T01115.418.93.50.30   JPRNFR20T01126.027.01.00.37  X-ManJPRXM20T0032.510.07.50.13   JPRXM20T00323.024.51.50.38   JPRXM20T0050.037.437.40.24   inc.0.06.06.00.56   JPRXM20T0062.012.010.00.41   inc.6.012.06.00.59  FrenzyJPRFRE20T0060.08.88.80.37  LifeboatJPRLFB20T00423.025.52.50.55    *Note: All widths are reported as those measured along the length of the trench. True widths are unknown at this time.QA/QC  Analytical work for the 2020 trenching program was performed by Bureau Veritas Canada Ltd., an internationally recognized analytical services provider, at its Vancouver, British Columbia laboratory.  Sample preparation was completed in two stages: crushing to a reject was carried out at its Whitehorse, Yukon facility, after which a 250 gram split was sent to the Vancouver, BC facility for pulverization. All trench samples were prepared using procedure PRP70-250 (crush 70% less than 2mm, riffle split off 250g, pulverize split to better than 85% passing 75 microns) and analyzed by method FA430 (30g fire assay with AAS finish) and AQ-201 (15g, aqua regia digestion and ICP-ES/MS analysis). Samples containing &amp;gt;10 g/t Au were reanalyzed using method FA530 (30g Fire Assay with gravimetric finish). The reported work was completed using industry standard procedures, including a quality assurance/quality control (“QA/QC”) program consisting of the insertion of certified standards and blanks into the sample stream.About White Gold Corp.

(TSX.V: WGO, OTC: WHGOF, FRA: 29W) (the “Company”) is pleased to announce positive trench, GT probe and soil sample results which identified additional and widespread structurally controlled gold mineralization at multiple targets on its road accessible JP Ross (“JPR”) property. The primary goal of the trenching program was to test identified soil and GT probe geochemistry anomalies and obtain a better understanding of the structural controls on mineralization to aid in drill planning. The positive results from this program in conjunction with other exploration results warranted follow-up exploration, with a series of rotary air blast (RAB) holes recently drilled to further test these targets, and additional RAB and diamond drilling planned for 2021. These activities form an integral part of the Company’s ongoing fully-funded $4 million exploration program backed by strategic partners Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (TSX: AEM, NYSE: AEM) and Kinross Gold Corp (TSX: K, NYSE: KGC), which also includes diamond drilling at the Ryan’s Surprise and Titan targets, RAB drilling at the Hen and JPR properties, and a significant regional program comprising soil and GT probe sampling and ground geophysical (magnetics and VLF-EM) surveys.  Highlights Include:  * Twenty-nine (29) trenches totalling 1,114 linear metres were trenched on 9 separate target areas utilizing an 8-ton tracked excavator. Results expanded known structurally controlled gold mineralization at multiple targets on the road accessible JPR property. Additional targets also to be tested in due course.  * Stage Fright target, trench JPRSF20T009 encountered a high-grade zone grading 8.88 g/t Au over 2.5m, and trench JPRSF20T010 exposed two separate mineralized zones grading 1.06 g/t Au over 2.5m, and 1.83 g/t Au over 2.5m.  * At the Sabotage target, five of seven trenches encountered gold mineralization including 3.40 g/t Au over 1.5m in trench JPRSAB20T023, 1.15 g/t Au over 8.5m in trench JPRSAB20T025, and 1.06 g/t Au over 2.1m and 15.00 g/t Au over 0.8m in trench JPRSAB20T029.  * Trenching on the North Frenzy target traced a north-south striking zone of mineralized quartz vein breccias with anomalous gold over a strike length of 600m.  * GT Probe (top of bedrock) samples on the newly identified and previously untested Notorious target area encountered multiple anomalous gold values ranging from 0.17 g/t Au to 24.4 g/t Au.  * Significant follow-up exploration work was executed pursuant to these findings which included expanded soil geochemistry surveys, a phase 2 trenching program utilizing a CanDig mini-excavator, hand excavated soil pits on existing anomalies and RAB drilling on several high priority targets.  * Virtual Site Tour &amp; Corporate Update Today @ 4PM EST (Details below)  Figures and images to accompany this news release can be found at: http://whitegoldcorp.ca/investors/exploration-highlights/.“We are pleased to have encountered additional gold mineralization across multiple recently identified zones as well as the high-grade gold mineralization on the newly discovered Notorious target, providing further indication that the abundant gold mineralization is part of a robust regional scale structurally controlled system. To date at least 14 gold targets have been identified on the JP Ross property across a 14km by 11km area, many within close proximity to significant current and historical placer gold operations,” stated David D’Onofrio, Chief Executive Officer. “This program has also provided valuable insight into the orientation and geometry of the mineralized systems, information that has been incorporated into our scientific and data driven methodology to define drill targets for the current and future seasons.”REMINDER: Invest Yukon Virtual Site Series Conference Virtual Site Tour Today @ 4PM EST   The Company will be a featured presenter at the Invest Yukon: Virtual Site Series, which will include a corporate overview followed by the premiere of the Company’s virtual site tour hosted by Shawn Ryan (Chief Technical Advisor) and Terry Brace (VP, Exploration). Conference registration details are provided below.Registration &amp; Event Details: https://my.6ix.com/KddB5xMw  Conference Dates: October 20th to 22nd, 2020  White Gold Corp. Presentation Date: October 22nd, 4:00 PM EST (1:00PM PST)JP Ross PropertyThe JPR is a large road accessible property covering 76,385 hectares centered on the famed Henderson Creek placer gold area located north of the Stewart River and east of the Yukon River. The property is located approximately 80km south of Dawson City, and 30km northeast of the Company’s flagship Golden Saddle and Arc deposits which have a mineral resource of 1,139,900 ounces Indicated at 2.28 g/t Au and 402,100 ounces Inferred at 1.39 g/t Au(1). Gold-related alteration and mineralization on the JPR property is predominantly structurally controlled and the area shows a complex structural history. Three primary fault systems are recognized, which from oldest to youngest are: 1) NNW to N-trending thrust faults; 2) WNW to E-W-trending sinistral faults; and 3) NE to NNE-trending sinistral and normal faults. The WNW to E-W-trending sinistral fault systems represent the best potential for orogenic gold, and the younger NE to NNE-trending sinistral and normal faults may potentially host porphyry-style copper-gold mineralization. Multiple gold-in-soil anomalies and target areas have been identified across the property, and recent drilling has confirmed gold mineralization with significant grades and widths, including 5.45 g/t Au over 4.57m in hole JPRNF19RAB-002 at North Frenzy, 5.44 g/t Au over 4.57m in hole JPRSF19RAB-005 at Stage Fright, 3.42 g/t Au over 7.62m in hole JPRSAB19RAB-011 at Sabotage, and 9.61 g/t Au over 4.15m in hole JPRVER19D0005 at Vertigo. Geochemical associations with gold appear to be target specific with mineralization occurring as Au-only, or associated with any combination of Pb, Bi, As, Ag, Cu, Te and Sb. Common accompanying sulphide minerals include pyrite, arsenopyrite and galena.JP Ross Trenching ProgramTwenty-nine (29) trenches totalling 1,114 linear metres were excavated in 9 separate target areas on the JPR property on targets highlighted by 2019 results from soil geochemistry, GT probe samples, VLF surveys, RAB drilling, and geological and structural interpretations. All trench locations were road accessible and were excavated utilizing an 8-ton tracked excavator. Overburden in the project area is thin, and individual trenches generally vary from 1.0m to 2.25m deep (average 1.75m) and from 10m to 100m long. Wherever possible, continuous composite chip samples were collected from each trench with sample lengths typically ranging between 0.5m and 2.5m. The weathered and fractured nature of surficial bedrock in this area precludes high pressure washing and channel sampling as is typical for many trenching programs in Canada.The primary goal of this work was to collect key structural data on mineralized veins, shear zones, faults, etc. which will aid in ongoing detailed interpretations and drill planning. The results have identified additional widespread structurally controlled gold mineralization at multiple targets. Prospective trench results from this program in conjunction with other exploration results, have been followed up with a series of RAB holes to drill test these targets and will be used to define future drill targets.Individual assays for the reported results ranged from trace to 15.0 g/t Au. The most significant results are discussed in more detail below.Supplementary JP Ross Exploration ProgramDuring September, additional exploration work was carried out on the JP Ross property to define and further test a number of additional anomalies and target areas. This work included:  * 835 additional soil samples to follow up on anomalies identified in earlier 2020 soil sampling.  * 88 GT Probe samples on 4 lines.  * 6 small ground magnetics and VLF-EM grids totalling 36.5 line km.  * 40 hand-dug soil pits on strong prospecting rock sample results and soil anomalies (focussing on gold values ranging from 200 ppb to 3,700 ppb Au). The pits were dug until sub-crop was encountered, or to the depth of the original soil sample (up to 1.0m deep). A total of 18 rock samples were collected from the pits for assay.  * 11 CanDig trenches totalling 384m.  * 615m of RAB drilling.Initial GT probe sample results received from the Notorious target area, located approximately 1.5km west of the North Frenzy, are encouraging with multiple samples returning anomalous gold values in the range of 0.17 g/t Au to 24.4 g/t Au. This new target area is located approximately 500m east of the intersection of two interpreted, property-scale sinistral faults, the west-northwest (285°) striking Frenzy Fault and the northeast (065°) striking Fright Fault. The 24.4 g/t Au probe sample was investigated by digging a 1.5m deep hand pit and a series of samples of the rocks encountered at all depths were collected. The deepest samples at 1.4m and 1.5m depths, returned portable XRF readings that are anomalous in tungsten, lead and bismuth, consistent with ICP analytical results received for the probe sample.The results for the additional exploration work programs, to be released in due course, will aid in planning exploration programs for the 2021 season, which is expected to include additional RAB and diamond drilling on several high priority targets.Summary of Trenching ResultsStage FrightThe Stage Fright is located 9.2km NW of Vertigo and covers multiple gold-in-soil anomalies over a 2,700m by 400m NE trend. Three (3) trenches were excavated at Stage Fright where previous CanDig trenching and RAB drilling encountered gold mineralization including 2.31 g/t Au over 16.76m in hole JPRSF19RAB-005. Trench JPRSF20T009 exposed a fracture-controlled oxidized zone in intermediate orthogneiss with narrow quartz and pyrite veinlets, which graded 8.88 g/t Au over 2.5m. Trench JPRSF20T010 cut a potassium feldspar and chlorite altered augen gneiss containing narrow quartz and specular hematite veinlets and exposed two separate mineralized zones grading 1.06 g/t Au over 2.5m and 1.83 g/t over 2.5m.SabotageThe Sabotage target is located approximately 7.5km NW of Vertigo and is comprised of a series of soil anomalies over a 2,100m by 800m NE trend. Seven (7) trenches were excavated at Sabotage with 4 being deeper re-digs of 2019 CanDig trenches that had encountered gold mineralization including 2.69 g/t Au over 10.0m in trench JPRSAB19T016 (see White Gold Corp. News Release dated October 17, 2019 available on SEDAR). Trench JPRSAB20T023 exposed 3 separate zones of gold mineralization including 0.56 g/t Au over 5.0m, 0.87 g/t Au 6.5m and 3.40 g/t Au over 1.5m. The latter mineralization is associated with a geological contact zone between mafic to intermediate gneiss and felsic orthogneiss, characterized by a 5m wide zone of parallel to subparallel quartz veinlets (10-50cm), vugs, oxidation and trace pyrite. Trench JPRSAB20T025 cut felsic orthogneiss with zones of strong sericitization and pervasive silica flooding, with one zone returning 1.15 g/t Au over 8.5m. Trench JPRSAB20T029 exposed felsic orthogneiss with potassic alteration, associated oxidation and hematite, and local strong silica flooding typically bounded by sericitization. Two separate mineralized gold zones graded 1.06 g/t Au over 2.1m and 15.00 g/t Au over 0.8m.North SabotageThe North Sabotage target is located approximately 9.0km NW of Vertigo. Two (2) trenches were excavated at North Sabotage, a 350m by 50m soil anomaly, to test strong gold-in-soil values of up to 760 ppb Au (trench JPRNSAB20T003) and 667 ppb Au (trench JPRNSAB20T004). Trench JPRNSAB20T004 cut strongly sericitized and well foliated felsic orthogneiss with one mineralized zone grading 1.79 g/t Au over 2.5m.VertigoFour (4) trenches were excavated at Vertigo primarily to test a number of interpreted fault structures. Three of the four trenches exposed narrow mineralized oxidized and vuggy quartz veins within felsic to intermediate gneisses including 4.51 g/t Au over 1.5m in JPRVER20T016, 0.91 g/t Au over 2.0m in JPRVER20T017, and 2.78 g/t Au over 1.8m in JPRVER20T018.North FrenzyNorth Frenzy is located 9km N of Vertigo. Four (4) trenches were excavated at North Frenzy where previous CanDig trenching and limited drilling (diamond and RAB drilling) encountered gold mineralization in quartz vein breccias in metaquartzites, associated with a 2km long north-south trending Au-Ag-As-Pb soil anomaly. Trenches JPRNF20T009, JPRNF20T010 and JPRNF20T011 each exposed quartz vein breccias which returned low-grade gold (0.20-0.50 g/t Au) over widths of approximately 2.0m to 10.0m. The zone is open along strike to the north and at depth.Frenzy, X-Man and LifeboatTwo (2) trenches at the Frenzy target located 7.6km N of Vertigo tested gold-in-soil and/or GT probe anomalies. Trench JPRFRE20T006 tested a soil anomaly of up to 357 ppb Au and GT Probe sample results of 0.37 to 1.35 g/t Au, and exposed strongly oxidized micaceous quartzites cut by thin quartz veinlets containing disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite and patchy quartz-sericite alteration. A single mineralized zone returned 0.37 g/t Au over 8.8m.A single trench at the Lifeboat target, located 7.3km NW of Vertigo, JPRLFB20T004 tested a gold-in-soil anomaly of up to 965 ppb Au, and a GT probe anomaly of up to 0.71 g/t Au.Four (4) trenches were excavated at the X-Man target located 12km NE of Vertigo, and based on existing geochemistry results, appears to represent a potential porphyry target. The trenches were primarily testing anomalous gold-in-soil anomalies with values in the range of 122 ppb Au to 319 ppb Au. The trenches exposed tuffaceous volcanic rocks of the Late Cretaceous Carmacks Group containing minor disseminated pyrite and multiple fracture sets. Three of four trenches returned anomalous gold ranging from 0.13 to 0.59 g/t Au over widths ranging from 1.5m to 37.4m.Table 1: Summary of Significant Gold Assay Results, 2020 JP Ross Property TrenchesTarget AreaTrench IDFromToWidth*Gold    (m)(m)(m)(g/t)  Stage FrightJPRSF20T00912.515.02.58.88   JPRSF20T01012.515.02.51.06   JPRSF20T01020.022.52.51.83  SabotageJPRSAB20T0232.57.55.00.56   JPRSAB20T02312.519.06.50.87   JPRSAB20T02338.540.01.53.40   JPRSAB20T0240.05.55.50.11   JPRSAB20T0257.516.08.51.15   inc.7.512.55.01.87   JPRSAB20T02615.822.87.00.25   JPRSAB20T0292.24.32.11.06   inc.2.22.80.63.05   JPRSAB20T02911.111.90.815.00  North Sabotage JPRNSAB20T00413.516.02.51.79  VertigoJPRVER20T01626.128.22.10.30   JPRVER20T01636.037.51.54.51   JPRVER20T01738.740.72.00.91   JPRVER20T0182.24.01.82.78  North FrenzyJPRNFR20T0095.010.55.50.21   JPRNFR20T00914.223.08.80.21   JPRNFR20T00930.532.52.00.44   JPRNFR20T0100.02.52.50.30   JPRNFR20T01030.032.52.50.48   JPRNFR20T0118.010.52.50.40   JPRNFR20T01115.418.93.50.30   JPRNFR20T01126.027.01.00.37  X-ManJPRXM20T0032.510.07.50.13   JPRXM20T00323.024.51.50.38   JPRXM20T0050.037.437.40.24   inc.0.06.06.00.56   JPRXM20T0062.012.010.00.41   inc.6.012.06.00.59  FrenzyJPRFRE20T0060.08.88.80.37  LifeboatJPRLFB20T00423.025.52.50.55    *Note: All widths are reported as those measured along the length of the trench. True widths are unknown at this time.QA/QC  Analytical work for the 2020 trenching program was performed by Bureau Veritas Canada Ltd., an internationally recognized analytical services provider, at its Vancouver, British Columbia laboratory.  Sample preparation was completed in two stages: crushing to a reject was carried out at its Whitehorse, Yukon facility, after which a 250 gram split was sent to the Vancouver, BC facility for pulverization. All trench samples were prepared using procedure PRP70-250 (crush 70% less than 2mm, riffle split off 250g, pulverize split to better than 85% passing 75 microns) and analyzed by method FA430 (30g fire assay with AAS finish) and AQ-201 (15g, aqua regia digestion and ICP-ES/MS analysis). Samples containing &amp;gt;10 g/t Au were reanalyzed using method FA530 (30g Fire Assay with gravimetric finish). The reported work was completed using industry standard procedures, including a quality assurance/quality control (“QA/QC”) program consisting of the insertion of certified standards and blanks into the sample stream.About White Gold Corp.

There are four key monetization opportunities for telcos in consumer IoT mentioned in this report.However, since none of these opportunities are mutually exclusive, most telcos today are attempting to ascertain the right focus and mix between the four approaches, and the state of today’s market can be summed up as a go-to-market trial and error.     Certainly, all telcos recognize that there is no clear or uncontested position for them in either the smart home or wide area connected device value chain, and finding the right niche and balance of monetization objectives is a longer-term strategic goal. For broadband and TV service providers, establishing a firm service foothold in the multiplay home for longer-term revenue protection is key.     The report provides an in-depth analysis of the following -   &amp;#92;- IoT taxonomy &amp; market context: an overview of IoT, IIoT, the telecom value chain with analysis and select telecom IoT services launches at a global level.   &amp;#92;- Telecom B2B IoT strategies and use cases: an overview of the key global telecom IoT use cases, value propositions, strategies, monetization models, service models.   &amp;#92;- Telecom consumer IoT strategies and use cases: this section provides an overview of the key global telecom IoT use cases, business strategies, monetization models, partnerships, key verticals, connectivity and connectivity platforms utilised.   &amp;#92;- Key findings and recommendations: the Global Outlook Report concludes with a number of key findings and a set of recommendations for B2B and consumer IoT stakeholders, especially telecom operators.     Scope   &amp;#92;- B2B IoT - Foster Development Community: Leaving app development to IT providers and systems integrators like IBM and Accenture leaves money on the table and cedes account control. If they are serious about value-added services, operators need to figure out a way either to develop branded applications in-house or to convince developers to do so.   &amp;#92;- Consumer IoT: Long-term customer value creation and loyalty is a key driver for telco innovation in the smart home. Many telcos today are seeking to align smart home packages with their multiplay portfolios, and in some cases, there is evidence of carriers offering their highest-spend convergence customers preferable pricing - a marketing strategy which warrants some study.   &amp;#92;- Operators should be proactive in identifying use cases and providing evidence of their success, including details on how much deployments are generating in revenues and other quantifiable metrics such as cost savings.     Reasons to Buy   &amp;#92;- This Global Outlook Report provides a comprehensive examination of telecom B2B and consumer IoT strategies, value chain, business models and use cases. It helps executives fully understand the ecosystem, market dynamics, latest developments and value chain. It helps telecom decision-makers determine key telecom IoT positioning strategies, formulate effective product development plans and optimize returns on investments.   &amp;#92;- Three B2B IoT and three Consumer IoT case studies illustrate the findings of the report, providing insights around different value propositions across the world, including services, monetization approaches and partnerships. This will help telecom executives craft adapted B2B and consumer IoT strategies to unlock new revenue streams.   &amp;#92;- The report discusses concrete opportunities in the telecom B2B and consumer IoT market, providing a number of actionable recommendations for IoT participants, including telecom operators.

Certainly, all telcos recognize that there is no clear or uncontested position for them in either the smart home or wide area connected device value chain, and finding the right niche and balance of monetization objectives is a longer-term strategic goal. For broadband and TV service providers, establishing a firm service foothold in the multiplay home for longer-term revenue protection is key.     The report provides an in-depth analysis of the following -   &amp;#92;- IoT taxonomy &amp; market context: an overview of IoT, IIoT, the telecom value chain with analysis and select telecom IoT services launches at a global level.   &amp;#92;- Telecom B2B IoT strategies and use cases: an overview of the key global telecom IoT use cases, value propositions, strategies, monetization models, service models.   &amp;#92;- Telecom consumer IoT strategies and use cases: this section provides an overview of the key global telecom IoT use cases, business strategies, monetization models, partnerships, key verticals, connectivity and connectivity platforms utilised.   &amp;#92;- Key findings and recommendations: the Global Outlook Report concludes with a number of key findings and a set of recommendations for B2B and consumer IoT stakeholders, especially telecom operators.     Scope   &amp;#92;- B2B IoT - Foster Development Community: Leaving app development to IT providers and systems integrators like IBM and Accenture leaves money on the table and cedes account control. If they are serious about value-added services, operators need to figure out a way either to develop branded applications in-house or to convince developers to do so.   &amp;#92;- Consumer IoT: Long-term customer value creation and loyalty is a key driver for telco innovation in the smart home. Many telcos today are seeking to align smart home packages with their multiplay portfolios, and in some cases, there is evidence of carriers offering their highest-spend convergence customers preferable pricing - a marketing strategy which warrants some study.   &amp;#92;- Operators should be proactive in identifying use cases and providing evidence of their success, including details on how much deployments are generating in revenues and other quantifiable metrics such as cost savings.     Reasons to Buy   &amp;#92;- This Global Outlook Report provides a comprehensive examination of telecom B2B and consumer IoT strategies, value chain, business models and use cases. It helps executives fully understand the ecosystem, market dynamics, latest developments and value chain. It helps telecom decision-makers determine key telecom IoT positioning strategies, formulate effective product development plans and optimize returns on investments.   &amp;#92;- Three B2B IoT and three Consumer IoT case studies illustrate the findings of the report, providing insights around different value propositions across the world, including services, monetization approaches and partnerships. This will help telecom executives craft adapted B2B and consumer IoT strategies to unlock new revenue streams.   &amp;#92;- The report discusses concrete opportunities in the telecom B2B and consumer IoT market, providing a number of actionable recommendations for IoT participants, including telecom operators.

Pre-tax pre-provision operating earnings(1) were $78.6 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020.  Net income available to common shareholders was $96.1 million and diluted earnings per common share were $1.22 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Pre-tax pre-provision operating earnings (1) were $217.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.“During the third quarter, Atlantic Union delivered strong financial results and continued to demonstrate the resilience, agility and innovation required to successfully navigate through the challenging economic, credit and interest rate headwinds of COVID-19,” said John C. Asbury, president and chief executive officer of Atlantic Union.“Operating under the mantra of soundness, profitability and growth – in that order of priority - Atlantic Union continues to be in a strong financial position with ample liquidity and a well-fortified capital base. Our financial performance has and will continue to benefit from the decisive actions the Company has taken to reduce its expense run rate to more closely align with revenue growth pressures driven by the lower for longer interest rate environment. These expense reduction actions include the consolidation of 14 branches in September, or nearly 10% of our branch network. Looking forward, we believe that Atlantic Union will emerge from the challenges of COVID-19 as a stronger company that is well positioned to generate sustainable, profitable growth and is committed to leveraging the Atlantic Union franchise to build long term value for our shareholders.”Small Business Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”)During 2020, the Company participated in the SBA PPP under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, which was intended to provide economic relief to small businesses that have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic (“COVID-19”). The Company processed over 11,000 PPP loans, which totaled $1.7 billion with a recorded investment of $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2020, which included unamortized deferred fees of $32.6 million. The loans carry a 1% interest rate.Expense Reduction MeasuresDuring 2020, the Company undertook several actions, including the consolidation of 14 branches, which was completed in September 2020, to reduce expenses in light of the current and expected operating environment. These actions resulted in expenses during the third quarter of 2020 of approximately $2.6 million, primarily related to lease termination costs and real estate write-downs.* * *(1) These are financial measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures, see Alternative Performance Measures (non-GAAP) section of the Key Financial ResultsNET INTEREST INCOMEFor the third quarter of 2020, net interest income was $137.4 million, an increase from $137.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2020. Net interest income (FTE)(1) was $140.3 million in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of $172,000 from the second quarter of 2020. The third quarter net interest margin decreased 15 basis points to 3.08% from 3.23% in the previous quarter, while the net interest margin (FTE)(1) decreased 15 basis points to 3.14% from 3.29% during the same period. The decreases in the net interest margin and net interest margin (FTE) were principally due to a 31 basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets (FTE)(1) offset by a 16 basis point decrease in cost of funds. The decline in the Company’s earning asset yields was driven by lower loan accretion income, an increase in the earning asset mix of lower yielding investment securities and the impact of lower market interest rates. The cost of funds decline was driven by lower deposit costs and wholesale borrowing costs driven by lower interest rate environment and a favorable funding mix.The Company’s net interest margin (FTE) includes the impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments. Net accretion related to acquisition accounting decreased $2.7 million from the prior quarter to $3.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. The second and third quarters of 2020, and the remaining estimated net accretion impact are reflected in the following table (dollars in thousands):                    Deposit           Loan Accretion Borrowings          Accretion    (Amortization)    Amortization    Total  For the quarter ended March 31, 2020 $9,528  50   (138) $9,440  For the quarter ended June 30, 2020  6,443  34   (140)  6,337  For the quarter ended September 30, 2020  3,814  26   (167)  3,673  For the remaining three months of 2020 (estimated)  2,530  23   (187)  2,366  For the years ending (estimated):                  2021  9,242  14   (807)  8,449  2022  7,449  (43)  (829)  6,577  2023  5,346  (32)  (852)  4,462  2024  4,334  (4)  (877)  3,453  2025  3,248  (1)  (900)  2,347  Thereafter  14,485  —   (9,873)  4,612  Total remaining acquisition accounting fair value adjustments at September 30, 2020  46,634  (43)  (14,325)  32,266    ASSET QUALITYOverview  During the third quarter of 2020, the Company experienced a slight decrease in nonperforming assets (“NPAs”). Past due loan levels as a percentage of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2020 were higher than past due loan levels at June 30, 2020 and lower than past due loan levels at September 30, 2019. The increase in past due loan levels from June 30, 2020 was primarily within the 30-59 days past due category. Net charge-off levels and the provision for loan losses for the third quarter of 2020 decreased from the second quarter of 2020.Loan Modifications for Borrowers Affected by COVID-19  On March 22, 2020, the five federal bank regulatory agencies and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors issued joint guidance (subsequently revised on April 7, 2020) with respect to loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19 (the “March 22 Joint Guidance”). The March 22 Joint Guidance encourages banks, savings associations, and credit unions to make loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19 and, importantly, assures those financial institutions that they will not (i) receive supervisory criticism for such prudent loan modifications and (ii) be required by examiners to automatically categorize COVID-19-related loan modifications as TDRs. The federal banking regulators have confirmed with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (or FASB) that short-term loan modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current (i.e., less than 30 days past due on contractual payments) when the modification program was implemented are not considered TDRs.* * *(1) These are financial measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures, see Alternative Performance Measures (non-GAAP) section of the Key Financial ResultsIn addition, Section 4013 of the CARES Act provides banks, savings associations, and credit unions with the ability to make loan modifications related to COVID-19 without categorizing the loan as a TDR or conducting the analysis to make the determination, which is intended to streamline the loan modification process. Any such suspension is effective for the term of the loan modification; however, the suspension is only permitted for loan modifications made during the effective period of Section 4013 and only for those loans that were not more than thirty days past due as of December 31, 2019.The Company has made certain loan modifications pursuant to the March 22 Joint Guidance or Section 4013 of the CARES Act and as of September 30, 2020 approximately $769.6 million remain under their modified terms, a decline of $831.3 million as compared to June 30, 2020. The majority of the Company’s modifications as of September 30, 2020 were in the commercial real estate portfolios.Nonperforming Assets  At September 30, 2020, NPAs totaled $43.2 million, a decrease of $839,000 from June 30, 2020. NPAs as a percentage of total outstanding loans at September 30, 2020 were 0.30%, a decrease of 1 basis point from 0.31% at June 30, 2020. Excluding the impact of the PPP loans(1), NPAs as a percentage of total outstanding loans were 0.34%, a decrease of 1 basis point from June 30, 2020.The Company’s adoption of current expected credit loss (“CECL”) on January 1, 2020 resulted in a change in the accounting and reporting related to purchased credit impaired (“PCI”) loans, which are now defined as purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) and evaluated at the loan level instead of being evaluated in pools under PCI accounting.   All prior period nonaccrual and past due loan metrics discussed herein have not been restated for CECL accounting and exclude PCI-related loan balances.The following table shows a summary of nonperforming asset balances at the quarter ended (dollars in thousands):                       September 30,     June 30,     March 31,     December 31,     September 30,     2020 2020 2020 2019 2019  Nonaccrual loans $39,023 $39,624 $44,022 $28,232 $30,032  Foreclosed properties  4,159  4,397  4,444  4,708  6,385  Total nonperforming assets $43,182 $44,021 $48,466 $32,940 $36,417    The following table shows the activity in nonaccrual loans for the quarter ended (dollars in thousands):                       September 30,     June 30,     March 31,     December 31,     September 30,     2020 2020 2020 2019 2019  Beginning Balance $39,624  $44,022  $28,232  $30,032  $27,462   Net customer payments  (2,803)  (6,524)  (3,451)  (5,741)  (3,612)  Additions  2,790   3,206   6,059   5,631   8,327   Impact of CECL adoption  —   —   14,381   —   —   Charge-offs  (588)  (1,088)  (1,199)  (1,690)  (884)  Loans returning to accruing status  —   8   —   —   (1,103)  Transfers to foreclosed property  —   —   —   —   (158)  Ending Balance $39,023  $39,624  $44,022  $28,232  $30,032     The following table shows the activity in foreclosed properties for the quarter ended (dollars in thousands):                       September 30,     June 30,     March 31,     December 31,     September 30,     2020 2020 2020 2019 2019  Beginning Balance $4,397  $4,444  $4,708  $6,385  $6,506   Additions of foreclosed property  —   —   615   62   645   Valuation adjustments  —   —   (44)  (375)  (62)  Proceeds from sales  (254)  (55)  (854)  (1,442)  (737)  Gains (losses) from sales  16   8   19   78   33   Ending Balance $4,159  $4,397  $4,444  $4,708  $6,385       * * *(1) These are financial measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures, see Alternative Performance Measures (non-GAAP) section of the Key Financial ResultsPast Due Loans  Past due loans still accruing interest totaled $50.9 million or 0.35% of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2020, compared to $40.5 million or 0.28% of total loans held for investment at June 30, 2020, and $55.1 million or 0.45% of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2019. Excluding the impact of the PPP loans(1), past due loans still accruing interest were 0.40% of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2020, compared to 0.32% of total loans held for investment at June 30, 2020. The increase in past due loans in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to the second quarter was primarily within the 30-59 days past due category and due to increases in past due credit relationships within the owner occupied commercial real estate, commercial &amp; industrial, and residential 1-4 family – consumer portfolios.Of the total past due loans still accruing interest, $15.6 million or 0.11% of total loans held for investment were loans past due 90 days or more at September 30, 2020, compared to $19.3 million or 0.13% of total loans held for investment at June 30, 2020, and $12.0 million or 0.10% of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2019.Net Charge-offs  For the third quarter of 2020, net charge-offs were $1.4 million, or 0.04% of total average loans on an annualized basis, compared to $3.3 million, or 0.09%, for the second quarter of 2020, and $7.7 million, or 0.25%, for the third quarter last year. Excluding the impact of the PPP loans(1), net charge-offs were 0.04% of total average loans on an annualized basis, compared to 0.10% for the second quarter of 2020. The majority of net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2020 were related to the third-party consumer loan portfolio.Provision for Credit Losses  The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2020 was $6.6 million, a decrease of $27.6 million compared to the previous quarter and a decrease of $2.5 million compared to the same quarter in 2019. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2020 consisted of $5.6 million in provision for loan losses and $1.0 million in provision for unfunded commitment.Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”)   At September 30, 2020, the ACL was $186.1 million and included an allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) of $174.1 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments (“RUC”) of $12.0 million. The ACL increased $5.1 million from June 30, 2020, primarily due to the continued economic uncertainty related to COVID-19.The ALLL increased $4.1 million and the RUC increased $1.0 million from June 30, 2020. The ALLL as a percentage of the total loan portfolio was 1.21% at September 30, 2020 and 1.19% at June 30, 2020. The ACL as percentage of total loans was 1.29% at September 30, 2020 and 1.26% at June 30, 2020. When excluding PPP loans(1), which are 100% guaranteed by the SBA, the ALLL as a percentage of adjusted loans increased 2 basis points to 1.36% from the prior quarter and the ACL as a percentage of adjusted loans increased 4 basis points to 1.46% from the prior quarter. The ratio of the ALLL to nonaccrual loans was 446.2% at September 30, 2020, compared to 429.0% at June 30, 2020.* * *(1) These are financial measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP.

These positive offsets include an increase in mortgage banking income of $3.1 million primarily due to increased mortgage loan origination volumes due to the current low interest rate environment. In addition, in the third quarter of 2020, $1.7 million in unrealized gains were recognized related to equity method investments that experienced unrealized losses during the second quarter, bank owned life insurance income increased $1.4 million primarily related to death benefit proceeds received during the quarter, and service charges on deposit accounts increased $1.1 million primarily due to higher NSF and overdraft fees.NONINTEREST EXPENSENoninterest expense decreased $9.6 million to $93.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 from $102.8 million in the prior quarter primarily driven by the recognition of approximately $10.3 million loss on debt extinguishment in the second quarter resulting from the prepayment of approximately $200.0 million in long-term FHLB advances. In addition, during the third quarter of 2020, there was a decline in the FDIC assessment of approximately $1.1 million due to the positive impact of PPP loans on the Company’s assessment rate. Noninterest expense also included approximately $2.6 million in costs related to the Company’s expense reduction plans, including the closure of 14 branches in September, approximately $639,000 in costs related to the Company’s response to COVID-19, and an increase in marketing expenses related to donations made by the Company to support organizations that fight the injustices of inequality and contribute to change in our communities.INCOME TAXESThe effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was 15.3% compared to 15.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2020.BALANCE SHEETAt September 30, 2020, total assets were $19.9 billion, an increase of $178.3 million, or approximately 3.6% (annualized), from June 30, 2020, and an increase of $2.5 billion, or approximately 14.3% from September 30, 2019. The increase in assets from the prior quarter was driven by an increase in the Company’s securities portfolio partially offset by a reduction in cash balances while growth from the prior year was primarily a result of both organic and PPP loan growth.At September 30, 2020, loans held for investment (net of deferred fees and costs) were $14.4 billion, an increase of $74.6 million, or 2.1% (annualized), from June 30, 2020, while average loans increased $401.0 million, or 11.4% (annualized), from the prior quarter. Loans held for investment (net of deferred fees and costs) increased $2.1 billion, or 16.9% from September 30, 2019, while quarterly average loans increased $2.1 billion, or 17.3% from the prior year. Excluding the effects of the PPP(2), loans held for investment (net of deferred fees and costs) increased $475.6 million, or 3.9%, while quarterly average loans increased $480.2 million, or 3.9% from the prior year.At September 30, 2020, total deposits were $15.6 billion, a slight decrease of $29.0 million, or approximately 0.7% (annualized), from June 30, 2020, while average deposits increased $620.1 million, or 16.5% (annualized), from the prior quarter. Deposits increased $2.5 billion, or 19.4% from September 30, 2019, while quarterly average deposits increased $2.8 billion, or 21.6% from the prior year. The increase in deposits from the prior year was primarily due to the impact of PPP loan related deposits and government stimulus.The following table shows the Company’s capital ratios at the quarters ended:               September 30,     June 30,     September 30,      2020 2020 2019   Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio (1) 10.04%  9.88%  10.48%  Tier 1 capital ratio (1) 11.18%  11.03%  10.48%  Total capital ratio (1) 13.92%  13.81%  12.93%  Leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average assets) (1) 8.82%  8.82%  8.94%  Common equity to total assets 12.52%  12.41%  14.48%  Tangible common equity to tangible assets (2) 7.91%  7.74%  9.23%      * * *(1) All ratios at September 30, 2020 are estimates and subject to change pending the Company’s filing of its FR Y9-C.

Net interest income (FTE) and total revenue (FTE), which are used in computing net interest margin (FTE) and operating efficiency ratio (FTE), respectively, provide valuable additional insight into the net interest margin and the efficiency ratio by adjusting for differences in tax treatment of interest income sources. The entire FTE adjustment is attributable to interest income on earning assets, which is used in computing yield on earning assets. Interest expense and the related cost of interest-bearing liabilities and cost of funds ratios are not affected by the FTE components.  (2) These are non-GAAP financial measures. Tangible common equity is used in the calculation of certain profitability, capital, and per share ratios. The Company believes tangible common equity and the related ratios are meaningful measures of capital adequacy because they provide a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which the Company believes will assist investors in assessing the capital of the Company and its ability to absorb potential losses.  (3) These are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that ROTCE is a meaningful supplement to GAAP financial measures and useful to investors because it measures the performance of a business consistently across time without regard to whether components of the business were acquired or developed internally.  (4) These are non-GAAP financial measures. Operating measures exclude merger and rebranding-related costs unrelated to the Company’s normal operations. The Company believes these measures are useful to investors as they exclude certain costs resulting from acquisition activity and allow investors to more clearly see the combined economic results of the organization’s operations.  (5) All ratios at September 30, 2020 are estimates and subject to change pending the Company’s filing of its FR Y9C. All other periods are presented as filed.  (6) Amounts are not directly comparable due to the Company’s adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. Prior to January 1, 2020, nonaccrual and past due loan information excluded PCI-related loan balances. These balances also reflect the impact of the CARES Act and March 22 Joint Guidance, which provides relief for TDR designations and also provides guidance on past due reporting for modified loans.   (7) The operating efficiency ratio (FTE) excludes the amortization of intangible assets and merger-related costs. This measure is similar to the measure utilized by the Company when analyzing corporate performance and is also similar to the measure utilized for incentive compensation. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors as it excludes certain costs resulting from acquisition activity allowing for greater comparability with others in the industry and allowing investors to more clearly see the combined economic results of the organization’s operations.  (8) This is a non-GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax pre-provision earnings excludes the provision for credit losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period under the recently adopted CECL methodology, merger and rebranding-related costs unrelated to the Company’s normal operations, and income tax expense. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors as it excludes certain costs resulting from acquisition activity as well as the potentially volatile provision measure, and allows for greater comparability with others in the industry and for investors to more clearly see the combined economic results of the organization’s operations.  (9) These are non-GAAP financial measures. PPP adjustment impact excludes the SBA guaranteed loans funded during the first half of 2020. The Company believes loans held for investment (net of deferred fees and costs), excluding PPP is useful to investors as it provides more clarity on the Company’s organic growth. The Company also believes that the related non-GAAP financial measures of past due loans still accruing interest as a percentage of total loans held for investment (net of deferred fees and costs), excluding PPP, are useful to investors as loans originated under the PPP carry an SBA guarantee. The Company believes that the ALLL as a percentage of loans held for investment (net of deferred fees and costs), excluding PPP, is useful to investors because of the size of the Company’s PPP originations and the impact of the embedded credit enhancement provided by the SBA guarantee.

Pre-tax pre-provision operating earnings(1) were $78.6 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020.  Net income available to common shareholders was $96.1 million and diluted earnings per common share were $1.22 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Pre-tax pre-provision operating earnings (1) were $217.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.“During the third quarter, Atlantic Union delivered strong financial results and continued to demonstrate the resilience, agility and innovation required to successfully navigate through the challenging economic, credit and interest rate headwinds of COVID-19,” said John C. Asbury, president and chief executive officer of Atlantic Union.“Operating under the mantra of soundness, profitability and growth – in that order of priority - Atlantic Union continues to be in a strong financial position with ample liquidity and a well-fortified capital base. Our financial performance has and will continue to benefit from the decisive actions the Company has taken to reduce its expense run rate to more closely align with revenue growth pressures driven by the lower for longer interest rate environment. These expense reduction actions include the consolidation of 14 branches in September, or nearly 10% of our branch network. Looking forward, we believe that Atlantic Union will emerge from the challenges of COVID-19 as a stronger company that is well positioned to generate sustainable, profitable growth and is committed to leveraging the Atlantic Union franchise to build long term value for our shareholders.”Small Business Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”)During 2020, the Company participated in the SBA PPP under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, which was intended to provide economic relief to small businesses that have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic (“COVID-19”). The Company processed over 11,000 PPP loans, which totaled $1.7 billion with a recorded investment of $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2020, which included unamortized deferred fees of $32.6 million. The loans carry a 1% interest rate.Expense Reduction MeasuresDuring 2020, the Company undertook several actions, including the consolidation of 14 branches, which was completed in September 2020, to reduce expenses in light of the current and expected operating environment. These actions resulted in expenses during the third quarter of 2020 of approximately $2.6 million, primarily related to lease termination costs and real estate write-downs.* * *(1) These are financial measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures, see Alternative Performance Measures (non-GAAP) section of the Key Financial ResultsNET INTEREST INCOMEFor the third quarter of 2020, net interest income was $137.4 million, an increase from $137.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2020. Net interest income (FTE)(1) was $140.3 million in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of $172,000 from the second quarter of 2020. The third quarter net interest margin decreased 15 basis points to 3.08% from 3.23% in the previous quarter, while the net interest margin (FTE)(1) decreased 15 basis points to 3.14% from 3.29% during the same period. The decreases in the net interest margin and net interest margin (FTE) were principally due to a 31 basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets (FTE)(1) offset by a 16 basis point decrease in cost of funds. The decline in the Company’s earning asset yields was driven by lower loan accretion income, an increase in the earning asset mix of lower yielding investment securities and the impact of lower market interest rates. The cost of funds decline was driven by lower deposit costs and wholesale borrowing costs driven by lower interest rate environment and a favorable funding mix.The Company’s net interest margin (FTE) includes the impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments. Net accretion related to acquisition accounting decreased $2.7 million from the prior quarter to $3.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. The second and third quarters of 2020, and the remaining estimated net accretion impact are reflected in the following table (dollars in thousands):                    Deposit           Loan Accretion Borrowings          Accretion    (Amortization)    Amortization    Total  For the quarter ended March 31, 2020 $9,528  50   (138) $9,440  For the quarter ended June 30, 2020  6,443  34   (140)  6,337  For the quarter ended September 30, 2020  3,814  26   (167)  3,673  For the remaining three months of 2020 (estimated)  2,530  23   (187)  2,366  For the years ending (estimated):                  2021  9,242  14   (807)  8,449  2022  7,449  (43)  (829)  6,577  2023  5,346  (32)  (852)  4,462  2024  4,334  (4)  (877)  3,453  2025  3,248  (1)  (900)  2,347  Thereafter  14,485  —   (9,873)  4,612  Total remaining acquisition accounting fair value adjustments at September 30, 2020  46,634  (43)  (14,325)  32,266    ASSET QUALITYOverview  During the third quarter of 2020, the Company experienced a slight decrease in nonperforming assets (“NPAs”). Past due loan levels as a percentage of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2020 were higher than past due loan levels at June 30, 2020 and lower than past due loan levels at September 30, 2019. The increase in past due loan levels from June 30, 2020 was primarily within the 30-59 days past due category. Net charge-off levels and the provision for loan losses for the third quarter of 2020 decreased from the second quarter of 2020.Loan Modifications for Borrowers Affected by COVID-19  On March 22, 2020, the five federal bank regulatory agencies and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors issued joint guidance (subsequently revised on April 7, 2020) with respect to loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19 (the “March 22 Joint Guidance”). The March 22 Joint Guidance encourages banks, savings associations, and credit unions to make loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19 and, importantly, assures those financial institutions that they will not (i) receive supervisory criticism for such prudent loan modifications and (ii) be required by examiners to automatically categorize COVID-19-related loan modifications as TDRs. The federal banking regulators have confirmed with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (or FASB) that short-term loan modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current (i.e., less than 30 days past due on contractual payments) when the modification program was implemented are not considered TDRs.* * *(1) These are financial measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures, see Alternative Performance Measures (non-GAAP) section of the Key Financial ResultsIn addition, Section 4013 of the CARES Act provides banks, savings associations, and credit unions with the ability to make loan modifications related to COVID-19 without categorizing the loan as a TDR or conducting the analysis to make the determination, which is intended to streamline the loan modification process. Any such suspension is effective for the term of the loan modification; however, the suspension is only permitted for loan modifications made during the effective period of Section 4013 and only for those loans that were not more than thirty days past due as of December 31, 2019.The Company has made certain loan modifications pursuant to the March 22 Joint Guidance or Section 4013 of the CARES Act and as of September 30, 2020 approximately $769.6 million remain under their modified terms, a decline of $831.3 million as compared to June 30, 2020. The majority of the Company’s modifications as of September 30, 2020 were in the commercial real estate portfolios.Nonperforming Assets  At September 30, 2020, NPAs totaled $43.2 million, a decrease of $839,000 from June 30, 2020. NPAs as a percentage of total outstanding loans at September 30, 2020 were 0.30%, a decrease of 1 basis point from 0.31% at June 30, 2020. Excluding the impact of the PPP loans(1), NPAs as a percentage of total outstanding loans were 0.34%, a decrease of 1 basis point from June 30, 2020.The Company’s adoption of current expected credit loss (“CECL”) on January 1, 2020 resulted in a change in the accounting and reporting related to purchased credit impaired (“PCI”) loans, which are now defined as purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) and evaluated at the loan level instead of being evaluated in pools under PCI accounting.   All prior period nonaccrual and past due loan metrics discussed herein have not been restated for CECL accounting and exclude PCI-related loan balances.The following table shows a summary of nonperforming asset balances at the quarter ended (dollars in thousands):                       September 30,     June 30,     March 31,     December 31,     September 30,     2020 2020 2020 2019 2019  Nonaccrual loans $39,023 $39,624 $44,022 $28,232 $30,032  Foreclosed properties  4,159  4,397  4,444  4,708  6,385  Total nonperforming assets $43,182 $44,021 $48,466 $32,940 $36,417    The following table shows the activity in nonaccrual loans for the quarter ended (dollars in thousands):                       September 30,     June 30,     March 31,     December 31,     September 30,     2020 2020 2020 2019 2019  Beginning Balance $39,624  $44,022  $28,232  $30,032  $27,462   Net customer payments  (2,803)  (6,524)  (3,451)  (5,741)  (3,612)  Additions  2,790   3,206   6,059   5,631   8,327   Impact of CECL adoption  —   —   14,381   —   —   Charge-offs  (588)  (1,088)  (1,199)  (1,690)  (884)  Loans returning to accruing status  —   8   —   —   (1,103)  Transfers to foreclosed property  —   —   —   —   (158)  Ending Balance $39,023  $39,624  $44,022  $28,232  $30,032     The following table shows the activity in foreclosed properties for the quarter ended (dollars in thousands):                       September 30,     June 30,     March 31,     December 31,     September 30,     2020 2020 2020 2019 2019  Beginning Balance $4,397  $4,444  $4,708  $6,385  $6,506   Additions of foreclosed property  —   —   615   62   645   Valuation adjustments  —   —   (44)  (375)  (62)  Proceeds from sales  (254)  (55)  (854)  (1,442)  (737)  Gains (losses) from sales  16   8   19   78   33   Ending Balance $4,159  $4,397  $4,444  $4,708  $6,385       * * *(1) These are financial measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures, see Alternative Performance Measures (non-GAAP) section of the Key Financial ResultsPast Due Loans  Past due loans still accruing interest totaled $50.9 million or 0.35% of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2020, compared to $40.5 million or 0.28% of total loans held for investment at June 30, 2020, and $55.1 million or 0.45% of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2019. Excluding the impact of the PPP loans(1), past due loans still accruing interest were 0.40% of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2020, compared to 0.32% of total loans held for investment at June 30, 2020. The increase in past due loans in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to the second quarter was primarily within the 30-59 days past due category and due to increases in past due credit relationships within the owner occupied commercial real estate, commercial &amp; industrial, and residential 1-4 family – consumer portfolios.Of the total past due loans still accruing interest, $15.6 million or 0.11% of total loans held for investment were loans past due 90 days or more at September 30, 2020, compared to $19.3 million or 0.13% of total loans held for investment at June 30, 2020, and $12.0 million or 0.10% of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2019.Net Charge-offs  For the third quarter of 2020, net charge-offs were $1.4 million, or 0.04% of total average loans on an annualized basis, compared to $3.3 million, or 0.09%, for the second quarter of 2020, and $7.7 million, or 0.25%, for the third quarter last year. Excluding the impact of the PPP loans(1), net charge-offs were 0.04% of total average loans on an annualized basis, compared to 0.10% for the second quarter of 2020. The majority of net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2020 were related to the third-party consumer loan portfolio.Provision for Credit Losses  The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2020 was $6.6 million, a decrease of $27.6 million compared to the previous quarter and a decrease of $2.5 million compared to the same quarter in 2019. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2020 consisted of $5.6 million in provision for loan losses and $1.0 million in provision for unfunded commitment.Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”)   At September 30, 2020, the ACL was $186.1 million and included an allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) of $174.1 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments (“RUC”) of $12.0 million. The ACL increased $5.1 million from June 30, 2020, primarily due to the continued economic uncertainty related to COVID-19.The ALLL increased $4.1 million and the RUC increased $1.0 million from June 30, 2020. The ALLL as a percentage of the total loan portfolio was 1.21% at September 30, 2020 and 1.19% at June 30, 2020. The ACL as percentage of total loans was 1.29% at September 30, 2020 and 1.26% at June 30, 2020. When excluding PPP loans(1), which are 100% guaranteed by the SBA, the ALLL as a percentage of adjusted loans increased 2 basis points to 1.36% from the prior quarter and the ACL as a percentage of adjusted loans increased 4 basis points to 1.46% from the prior quarter. The ratio of the ALLL to nonaccrual loans was 446.2% at September 30, 2020, compared to 429.0% at June 30, 2020.* * *(1) These are financial measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP.

These positive offsets include an increase in mortgage banking income of $3.1 million primarily due to increased mortgage loan origination volumes due to the current low interest rate environment. In addition, in the third quarter of 2020, $1.7 million in unrealized gains were recognized related to equity method investments that experienced unrealized losses during the second quarter, bank owned life insurance income increased $1.4 million primarily related to death benefit proceeds received during the quarter, and service charges on deposit accounts increased $1.1 million primarily due to higher NSF and overdraft fees.NONINTEREST EXPENSENoninterest expense decreased $9.6 million to $93.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 from $102.8 million in the prior quarter primarily driven by the recognition of approximately $10.3 million loss on debt extinguishment in the second quarter resulting from the prepayment of approximately $200.0 million in long-term FHLB advances. In addition, during the third quarter of 2020, there was a decline in the FDIC assessment of approximately $1.1 million due to the positive impact of PPP loans on the Company’s assessment rate. Noninterest expense also included approximately $2.6 million in costs related to the Company’s expense reduction plans, including the closure of 14 branches in September, approximately $639,000 in costs related to the Company’s response to COVID-19, and an increase in marketing expenses related to donations made by the Company to support organizations that fight the injustices of inequality and contribute to change in our communities.INCOME TAXESThe effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was 15.3% compared to 15.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2020.BALANCE SHEETAt September 30, 2020, total assets were $19.9 billion, an increase of $178.3 million, or approximately 3.6% (annualized), from June 30, 2020, and an increase of $2.5 billion, or approximately 14.3% from September 30, 2019. The increase in assets from the prior quarter was driven by an increase in the Company’s securities portfolio partially offset by a reduction in cash balances while growth from the prior year was primarily a result of both organic and PPP loan growth.At September 30, 2020, loans held for investment (net of deferred fees and costs) were $14.4 billion, an increase of $74.6 million, or 2.1% (annualized), from June 30, 2020, while average loans increased $401.0 million, or 11.4% (annualized), from the prior quarter. Loans held for investment (net of deferred fees and costs) increased $2.1 billion, or 16.9% from September 30, 2019, while quarterly average loans increased $2.1 billion, or 17.3% from the prior year. Excluding the effects of the PPP(2), loans held for investment (net of deferred fees and costs) increased $475.6 million, or 3.9%, while quarterly average loans increased $480.2 million, or 3.9% from the prior year.At September 30, 2020, total deposits were $15.6 billion, a slight decrease of $29.0 million, or approximately 0.7% (annualized), from June 30, 2020, while average deposits increased $620.1 million, or 16.5% (annualized), from the prior quarter. Deposits increased $2.5 billion, or 19.4% from September 30, 2019, while quarterly average deposits increased $2.8 billion, or 21.6% from the prior year. The increase in deposits from the prior year was primarily due to the impact of PPP loan related deposits and government stimulus.The following table shows the Company’s capital ratios at the quarters ended:               September 30,     June 30,     September 30,      2020 2020 2019   Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio (1) 10.04%  9.88%  10.48%  Tier 1 capital ratio (1) 11.18%  11.03%  10.48%  Total capital ratio (1) 13.92%  13.81%  12.93%  Leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average assets) (1) 8.82%  8.82%  8.94%  Common equity to total assets 12.52%  12.41%  14.48%  Tangible common equity to tangible assets (2) 7.91%  7.74%  9.23%      * * *(1) All ratios at September 30, 2020 are estimates and subject to change pending the Company’s filing of its FR Y9-C.

The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures discussed herein in its analysis of the Company’s performance. The Company’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results of operations with prior periods and show the effects of significant gains and charges in the periods presented without the impact of items or events that may obscure trends in the Company’s underlying performance.

Net interest income (FTE) and total revenue (FTE), which are used in computing net interest margin (FTE) and operating efficiency ratio (FTE), respectively, provide valuable additional insight into the net interest margin and the efficiency ratio by adjusting for differences in tax treatment of interest income sources. The entire FTE adjustment is attributable to interest income on earning assets, which is used in computing yield on earning assets. Interest expense and the related cost of interest-bearing liabilities and cost of funds ratios are not affected by the FTE components.  (2) These are non-GAAP financial measures. Tangible common equity is used in the calculation of certain profitability, capital, and per share ratios. The Company believes tangible common equity and the related ratios are meaningful measures of capital adequacy because they provide a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which the Company believes will assist investors in assessing the capital of the Company and its ability to absorb potential losses.  (3) These are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that ROTCE is a meaningful supplement to GAAP financial measures and useful to investors because it measures the performance of a business consistently across time without regard to whether components of the business were acquired or developed internally.  (4) These are non-GAAP financial measures. Operating measures exclude merger and rebranding-related costs unrelated to the Company’s normal operations. The Company believes these measures are useful to investors as they exclude certain costs resulting from acquisition activity and allow investors to more clearly see the combined economic results of the organization’s operations.  (5) All ratios at September 30, 2020 are estimates and subject to change pending the Company’s filing of its FR Y9C. All other periods are presented as filed.  (6) Amounts are not directly comparable due to the Company’s adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. Prior to January 1, 2020, nonaccrual and past due loan information excluded PCI-related loan balances. These balances also reflect the impact of the CARES Act and March 22 Joint Guidance, which provides relief for TDR designations and also provides guidance on past due reporting for modified loans.   (7) The operating efficiency ratio (FTE) excludes the amortization of intangible assets and merger-related costs. This measure is similar to the measure utilized by the Company when analyzing corporate performance and is also similar to the measure utilized for incentive compensation. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors as it excludes certain costs resulting from acquisition activity allowing for greater comparability with others in the industry and allowing investors to more clearly see the combined economic results of the organization’s operations.  (8) This is a non-GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax pre-provision earnings excludes the provision for credit losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period under the recently adopted CECL methodology, merger and rebranding-related costs unrelated to the Company’s normal operations, and income tax expense. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors as it excludes certain costs resulting from acquisition activity as well as the potentially volatile provision measure, and allows for greater comparability with others in the industry and for investors to more clearly see the combined economic results of the organization’s operations.  (9) These are non-GAAP financial measures. PPP adjustment impact excludes the SBA guaranteed loans funded during the first half of 2020. The Company believes loans held for investment (net of deferred fees and costs), excluding PPP is useful to investors as it provides more clarity on the Company’s organic growth. The Company also believes that the related non-GAAP financial measures of past due loans still accruing interest as a percentage of total loans held for investment (net of deferred fees and costs), excluding PPP, are useful to investors as loans originated under the PPP carry an SBA guarantee. The Company believes that the ALLL as a percentage of loans held for investment (net of deferred fees and costs), excluding PPP, is useful to investors because of the size of the Company’s PPP originations and the impact of the embedded credit enhancement provided by the SBA guarantee.

(“Sarepta”) (NASDAQ: SRPT), a leader in precision genetic medicine for rare diseases, today announced a $107 million Series A financing to create AavantiBio, a gene therapy company focused on transforming the lives of patients with rare genetic diseases. The private financing round includes a $15 million equity investment from Sarepta.Alexander “Bo” Cumbo, a seasoned biopharmaceutical executive, has been appointed AavantiBio’s Chief Executive Officer and President, effective immediately. Mr. Cumbo joins the Company after eight years at Sarepta, where he served as Chief Commercial Officer and Executive Vice President. He will continue to serve as an advisor to Sarepta through December 31, 2020.Headquartered in the greater Boston area, AavantiBio is co-founded by renowned gene therapy researchers Barry Byrne, M.D., Ph.D., and Manuela Corti, P.T., Ph.D., who together bring thirty years of experience to the Company. AavantiBio’s lead program is in Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA), a rare inherited genetic disease that causes cardiac and central nervous system dysfunction. AavantiBio’s research efforts expand on foundational research conducted by Drs. Byrne and Corti in Friedreich’s Ataxia, among other rare genetic disorders. AavantiBio will benefit from strategic partnerships with the University of Florida’s renowned Powell Gene Therapy Center and the MDA Care Center at UF Health where Drs. Byrne and Corti maintain their research and clinical practices. Initial funding in AavantiBio was provided by GoFAR, an Italian patient advocacy group, and the Muscular Dystrophy Association Venture Philanthropy Fund.“The past eight years have been some of the most rewarding of my career as Sarepta has emerged as a pioneer for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy patients and transformed into a genetic medicine leader,” Mr. Cumbo stated. “It has been a privilege to contribute to this growth and play a role in serving these communities. As I look ahead to the bright future of AavantiBio and the exciting opportunity to lead this innovative Company, this same dedication to serving unmet patient needs and to leveraging deep scientific expertise will be core to our mission. I am also thrilled to continue to collaborate with the talented team at Sarepta.”“Our equity participation in AavantiBio serves our strategy to build our gene therapy engine through targeted investment in potentially life-enhancing therapies as well as partnering with renowned genetic medicine pioneers such as Drs. Byrne and Corti,” stated Doug Ingram, president and CEO, Sarepta Therapeutics. Mr. Ingram continued: “Bo Cumbo has built a first-in-class rare disease commercial organization and has made tremendous contributions to Sarepta. We look forward to continuing to work with Bo as he builds a strong AavantiBio team and advances therapies to treat FA and other rare diseases.”Prior to joining Sarepta in 2013, Mr. Cumbo served as Vice President of Sales and Treatment Education at Vertex Pharmaceuticals where he built a sales force to market their first commercial drug, Incivek—an oral treatment for hepatitis C. Previously, he spent nine years at Gilead Sciences where he served in multiple commercial roles supporting the company’s HIV, HBV, and cardiovascular franchises. Mr. Cumbo has extensive experience building global commercial infrastructure, and throughout his career, he has contributed to the launch of 11 specialty products across multiple organizations. He received his Bachelor of Science in Laboratory Technology from Auburn University.“AavantiBio has a unique opportunity to change the lives of those living with FA and other rare diseases,” Mr. Cumbo added. “Central to our mission is building on the advancements in gene transfer therapies and harnessing these revolutionary technologies to realize their potential as life-altering medicines. I’m excited to build a company focused on deep science, innovation, and collaboration, and grateful for the partnership with three of the biotechnology industry’s most respected investors in Perceptive Advisors, Bain Capital, and RA Capital.”“Our investment in AavantiBio represents a truly unique opportunity to thoughtfully advance a differentiated pipeline of innovative gene transfer therapies in areas of high unmet medical need,” the Investor Group said in a statement. “We are excited to collaborate with Bo Cumbo, an accomplished executive leader, and to provide the necessary resources to enable the Company to build a best-in-class gene therapy platform that brings transformative products to patients and families impacted by these devastating diseases.”The AavantiBio Board of Directors will be comprised of 8 Directors, including Mr. Cumbo, Drs. Byrne and Corti, representatives of the Investor Group, and two Independent Directors. Louise Rodino-Klapac, Ph.D., senior vice president of gene therapy for Sarepta, will serve as a Board Observer.About Friedreich’s AtaxiaFriedreich’s Ataxia (also known as FA or Friedreich Ataxia) is a rare inherited genetic disease that causes movement problems and nervous system damage. Over time, the disease leads to degeneration in the spinal cord, peripheral nerves and cerebellum (the part of the brain that controls synchronization and balance) and causes impaired muscle coordination (ataxia) that gets worse over time. Poor coordination is one of the first noticeable features of FA. The neurological degeneration caused by the disease results in unsteady movements, impaired sensory function, and even the loss of speech. Affected individuals can also develop heart problems, diabetes, or curvature of the spine. However, the disorder does not affect cognitive ability. Though rare, FA affects 1 in every 40,000-50,000 people and is the most common form of hereditary ataxia in the United States.About AavantiBio, Inc.AavantiBio’s vision is to harness the transformative science of gene transfer therapy and gene editing technologies to improve the lives of people living with fatal diseases. Founded by distinguished gene therapy researchers out of the University of Florida, the Company is advancing a pipeline of innovative gene transfer therapies in areas of high unmet medical need, which have the potential to become the next generation of life-changing medicines.

Mr. Cumbo joins the Company after eight years at Sarepta, where he served as Chief Commercial Officer and Executive Vice President. He will continue to serve as an advisor to Sarepta through December 31, 2020.Headquartered in the greater Boston area, AavantiBio is co-founded by renowned gene therapy researchers Barry Byrne, M.D., Ph.D., and Manuela Corti, P.T., Ph.D., who together bring thirty years of experience to the Company. AavantiBio’s lead program is in Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA), a rare inherited genetic disease that causes cardiac and central nervous system dysfunction. AavantiBio’s research efforts expand on foundational research conducted by Drs. Byrne and Corti in Friedreich’s Ataxia, among other rare genetic disorders. AavantiBio will benefit from strategic partnerships with the University of Florida’s renowned Powell Gene Therapy Center and the MDA Care Center at UF Health where Drs. Byrne and Corti maintain their research and clinical practices. Initial funding in AavantiBio was provided by GoFAR, an Italian patient advocacy group, and the Muscular Dystrophy Association Venture Philanthropy Fund.“The past eight years have been some of the most rewarding of my career as Sarepta has emerged as a pioneer for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy patients and transformed into a genetic medicine leader,” Mr. Cumbo stated. “It has been a privilege to contribute to this growth and play a role in serving these communities.

Louise Rodino-Klapac, Ph.D., senior vice president of gene therapy for Sarepta, will serve as a Board Observer.About Friedreich’s AtaxiaFriedreich’s Ataxia (also known as FA or Friedreich Ataxia) is a rare inherited genetic disease that causes movement problems and nervous system damage. Over time, the disease leads to degeneration in the spinal cord, peripheral nerves and cerebellum (the part of the brain that controls synchronization and balance) and causes impaired muscle coordination (ataxia) that gets worse over time. Poor coordination is one of the first noticeable features of FA. The neurological degeneration caused by the disease results in unsteady movements, impaired sensory function, and even the loss of speech. Affected individuals can also develop heart problems, diabetes, or curvature of the spine. However, the disorder does not affect cognitive ability. Though rare, FA affects 1 in every 40,000-50,000 people and is the most common form of hereditary ataxia in the United States.About AavantiBio, Inc.AavantiBio’s vision is to harness the transformative science of gene transfer therapy and gene editing technologies to improve the lives of people living with fatal diseases. Founded by distinguished gene therapy researchers out of the University of Florida, the Company is advancing a pipeline of innovative gene transfer therapies in areas of high unmet medical need, which have the potential to become the next generation of life-changing medicines.

We see increased customer engagement across the entire platform of Watsco technologies. These tools and capabilities are unique in the industry and are designed to help HVAC contractors of any size grow faster and become more efficient. The progress we have made gives us confidence in the long-term and emboldens us to do more.”Financial Strength &amp; LiquidityThe Company’s long-standing goal is to maintain a conservative balance sheet that allows it to invest in new growth opportunities as they arise. During the third quarter 2020, Watsco grew its cash position and reduced debt to nearly zero. The Company maintains a $560 million revolving credit facility, the borrowings under which are typically seasonal in nature. Watsco believes its conservative financial position and access to low-cost capital provide confidence to its customers, employees and OEM partners. The strong balance sheet also affords Watsco the capacity to invest in almost any-sized growth opportunity.Cash Flow &amp; DividendsOperating cash flow for the nine-month period was a record $373 million versus $198 million in 2019. Watsco expects to meet or exceed its annual goal of producing cash flow in excess of net income in 2020. Since 2000, Watsco has generated operating cash flow of approximately $3.1 billion compared to net income of approximately $2.9 billion, surpassing the Company’s stated goal of generating cash flow in excess of net income.Watsco has paid cash dividends for 46 consecutive years. Dividends paid through September 30, 2020 increased 9% to $197 million. The Company’s philosophy is to share increasing amounts of cash flow with shareholders through higher dividends while maintaining a conservative financial position. Effective April 2020, Watsco raised its annual dividend rate 11% to $7.10 per share. Future increases in dividends will be considered in light of investment opportunities, cash flow, general economic conditions and the Company’s overall financial condition.Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call InformationDate: October 22, 2020  Time: 10:00 a.m. (EDT)  Webcast: http://investors.watsco.com  Dial-in number: United States (844) 883-3908 / International (412) 317-9254A replay of the conference call will be available on the Company’s website.Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information   In this release, the Company discloses non-GAAP measures referring to “same-store basis,” which exclude the effects of locations closed, acquired, or locations opened, in each case during the immediately preceding 12 months unless such locations are within close geographical proximity to existing locations.

Watsco estimates that more than 300,000 contractors and technicians visit or call one of its 603 locations each year to get information, obtain technical support and buy products. HVAC/R products provide comfort to homes and businesses regardless of the outdoor climate. Older systems often operate below today’s government mandated energy efficiency and environmental standards. Watsco has an opportunity to accelerate the replacement of these systems at a scale greater than its competitors as the movement toward reducing energy consumption and its environmental impact continues. This is especially important since heating and cooling accounts for approximately half of the energy consumed in a typical U.S. home.

Technology investments designed to revolutionize Watsco’s customer experience have also proven critical during a challenging operating environment. Notably, adoption of mobile apps and customer-facing platforms, including e-commerce, has grown, enabling more customers to engage digitally. In addition, curbside / dockside technology has been implemented to facilitate contactless order fulfillment and help customers and employees operate safely and effectively. Taken as a whole, we believe Watsco’s technology offering is unique to the industry, solidifies existing customer relationships and creates new-customer opportunities to generate long-term growth and market share gains.Third Quarter Performance Metrics  * 25% EPS increase to a record $2.76  * 25% operating income increase to a record $157 million  * 120 basis-point operating margin expansion to a record 10.2%  * 28% growth in net income attributable to Watsco to a record $106 million  * 10% sales growth to a record $1.54 billion (8% same-store increase, including 15% in U.S. markets)  * 12% gross profit increase to a record $374 million (30 basis-point increase in gross margin)  * 4% SG&amp;A expense increase, including new locations  * Flat same-store SG&amp;A expenses (100 basis-point decrease as a percentage of sales)Sales trends (excluding acquisitions):  * 10% growth in HVAC equipment (70% of sales), including 19% growth in U.S. residential products  * 2% increase in other HVAC products (27% of sales)  * Flat sales in commercial refrigeration products (3% of sales)  Albert H.

We further strengthened our balance sheet, as evidenced by our record cash flow and debt reduction.

These investments make it easier for HVAC contractors to do business with Watsco and, in turn, improve the speed, efficiency and growth opportunities of our customers. Specific technology-related achievements thus far in 2020 include:  * Product Information Management (PIM) is the industry’s leading repository of product information delivered seamlessly in digital form through Watsco’s mobile apps and e-commerce to HVAC contractors in the field. Today Watsco has digitized product information for approximately 850,000 SKUs accessed by more than 300,000 customers and technicians.     * Contractor Assist mobile apps provide customers with interactive access to sales, technical support, product and inventory information, warranty look-up, and much more. Customer use of Watsco’s innovative mobile apps expanded with average weekly users growing 31% year to date.     * E-Commerce sales continued to grow as more customers transacted online. At September 30, 2020 versus one year ago, the number of customers using e-commerce has grown by 24% and e-commerce sales orders grew by 30%. The current annual run-rate for e-commerce sales is $1.5 billion or approximately 32% of total sales.     * Investments in proprietary warehouse technology that deliver speed, convenience and order accuracy have improved same-store productivity. Express Pick-up orders have grown 38% year to date enabling faster, more convenient service to customers. The recently-launched curbside capabilities saw more than 12,000 orders fulfilled by more than 2,000 unique users in its first months of use. Inventory turns also improved by 25 basis-points for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2020.    * OnCall Air®, Watsco’s digital sales platform for HVAC/R contractors, and CreditForComfort®, its companion financing platform, have also gained traction as more homeowners transact digitally with HVAC contractors. During the third quarter 2020, OnCall Air® presented quotes to more than 39,000 households and generated $114 million in gross merchandise value for our customers, a 92% increase over last year. CreditForComfort® processed more than 1,800 retail financing applications during the quarter, a 122% increase over last year resulting in an 87% quarter-over-quarter increase in funded loans.AJ Nahmad, Watsco’s President, commented: “Our journey to drive technology adoption at scale has yielded great results, but we are even more excited at the opportunities that lay ahead. We see increased customer engagement across the entire platform of Watsco technologies. These tools and capabilities are unique in the industry and are designed to help HVAC contractors of any size grow faster and become more efficient. The progress we have made gives us confidence in the long-term and emboldens us to do more.”Financial Strength &amp; LiquidityThe Company’s long-standing goal is to maintain a conservative balance sheet that allows it to invest in new growth opportunities as they arise. During the third quarter 2020, Watsco grew its cash position and reduced debt to nearly zero. The Company maintains a $560 million revolving credit facility, the borrowings under which are typically seasonal in nature. Watsco believes its conservative financial position and access to low-cost capital provide confidence to its customers, employees and OEM partners. The strong balance sheet also affords Watsco the capacity to invest in almost any-sized growth opportunity.Cash Flow &amp; DividendsOperating cash flow for the nine-month period was a record $373 million versus $198 million in 2019. Watsco expects to meet or exceed its annual goal of producing cash flow in excess of net income in 2020. Since 2000, Watsco has generated operating cash flow of approximately $3.1 billion compared to net income of approximately $2.9 billion, surpassing the Company’s stated goal of generating cash flow in excess of net income.Watsco has paid cash dividends for 46 consecutive years. Dividends paid through September 30, 2020 increased 9% to $197 million. The Company’s philosophy is to share increasing amounts of cash flow with shareholders through higher dividends while maintaining a conservative financial position. Effective April 2020, Watsco raised its annual dividend rate 11% to $7.10 per share. Future increases in dividends will be considered in light of investment opportunities, cash flow, general economic conditions and the Company’s overall financial condition.Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call InformationDate: October 22, 2020  Time: 10:00 a.m. (EDT)  Webcast: http://investors.watsco.com  Dial-in number: United States (844) 883-3908 / International (412) 317-9254A replay of the conference call will be available on the Company’s website.Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information   In this release, the Company discloses non-GAAP measures referring to “same-store basis,” which exclude the effects of locations closed, acquired, or locations opened, in each case during the immediately preceding 12 months unless such locations are within close geographical proximity to existing locations. The Company believes that this information provides greater comparability regarding its ongoing operating performance. These measures should not be considered an alternative to measurements required by U.S. GAAP.About WatscoWatsco is the largest distribution network for heating, air conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC/R) products with locations in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico, and on an export basis to Latin America and the Caribbean. Watsco estimates that more than 300,000 contractors and technicians visit or call one of its 603 locations each year to get information, obtain technical support and buy products. HVAC/R products provide comfort to homes and businesses regardless of the outdoor climate. Older systems often operate below today’s government mandated energy efficiency and environmental standards. Watsco has an opportunity to accelerate the replacement of these systems at a scale greater than its competitors as the movement toward reducing energy consumption and its environmental impact continues. This is especially important since heating and cooling accounts for approximately half of the energy consumed in a typical U.S. home.

The Company previously reported on the Phase 1 bench-scale metallurgical testing program (news release dated August 20, 2020) that determined the recovery to be used for the Feasibility Study and the expected recoveries for the Project going forward. The Phase 1 Metallurgical Testing program achieved the following results:2020 Phase 1 Metallurgical Recovery 1  (as determined by 2020 Met Testing)PEA2 Metallurgical Recovery     Variance   &amp;#92;+ positive    &amp;#92;- negative  Palladium  (Pd)86.9%82.9%+4.0%  Copper3   (Cu)93.0%90.0%3+3.0%  Platinum  (Pt)84.2%74.5%+9.7%  Gold  (Au)72.4%73.2%-0.8%  Silver  (Ag)Not evaluated in this program71.5%n/a  1 Recovery calculations are based on the established head grade of composite samples ranging in Cu, Pd, Pt, and Au head grade and involving multiple benchscale flotation tests.    2 Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) of the Company titled “Amended Technical Report, Updated Mineral Resource Estimate and Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Marathon Deposit, Thunder Bay Mining District Northwestern Ontario Canada” dated July 6, 2020 (effective date of January 6, 2020);    3 The estimated recovery of Cu is noted per the PEA for years 6-14     In September 2020, the Company progressed to a Phase 2 metallurgical testing program, again at SGS Canada Inc. in Lakefield, Ontario. The Phase 2 Metallurgical Testing program is being overseen by Steve Haggarty, P.Eng., of Haggarty Technical Services (“HTS”) and Ausenco Engineering Canada Inc. (“Ausenco”) (acting as the Qualified Person for the upcoming metallurgical and processing sections of the Feasibility Study Technical Report). The goal of this program is to further define (i) the performance of the cleaning and scavenger flotation circuits, (ii) the optimal grind size in the regrind circuit and (iii) the overall validation of the circuit performance with a mini-pilot plant. The first two tasks have been completed. The initial locked cycle testing and a pilot plant program commenced mid-October and will be completed during November 2020.The Phase 2 metallurgical and the pilot plant will involve three bulk sample composites with varying Palladium (Pd) and Copper (Cu) content from freshly excavated material in the Main Zone, W-Horizon, and a composite previous collected in 2012. The range in grade and material types will allow the Company to optimize process design criteria and Pd-Cu recovery, while advancing predictive Geo-Met modeling to estimate Life of Mine plan metal recoveries from the deposit.The progress that has been realized on Phase 1 and Phase 2 testing to date:  1. Optimized initial grind size and applied flotation reagents to maximize platinum group metals (PGM) and Cu recovery to rougher concentrate;  2. Optimized rougher concentrate regrind size and cleaner circuit performance to maximize PGM-Cu capture to final concentrate;  3. Confirmed the applicability of magnetic separation for pyrrhotite mineralization associated with the Marathon Palladium project to provide NSR optionality for separate PGM-Cu and iron sulfide-PGM-Cu concentrates;  4. Confirmed the applicability of a cycloned coarse/fine fraction of rougher tailings that would be subject to additional regrinding to provide incremental PGM recovery for the project;  5. Validated the performance of Woodgrove Direct Flotation Reactor (DFR) technology which would provide similar or improved PGM-Cu recovery at higher concentration ratios (lower mass pull);  6. Implementation of DFR technology will decrease the footprint associated with the flotation portion of the processing plant; a smaller footprint will reduce the capital cost associated with the construction and is expected to decrease the plant operating costs and carbon footprint through reduced energy consumption;  7. Confirmed that the alternate flowsheet (Figure 1) for plant design has improved performance and operability over previously defined process concepts from the 2020 PEA (Technical Report 6 July 2020).“We believe that the processing plant flowsheet is an improvement over the past design and the metallurgical testing programs have shown improved recoveries. The achieved successes and the validation of the flowsheet will be carried forward in Feasibility Study designs and into the subsequent detailed engineering phase. We see the achieved recoveries and overall design to be very positive for the overall Project”, stated Drew Anwyll, Chief Operating Officer, Generation Mining.Figure 1 below is the processing plant flowsheet for the Marathon Project.A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/fd84c9cc-ec5f-4a4b-b747-34d2c0eb81achttps://genmining.com/site/assets/files/3765/marathon_palladium_project_simplified_flowsheet.pdf   https://genmining.com/site/assets/files/3765/marathon_pgm_flotation_circuit_revd.pdfThe Phase 2 pilot plant testing will be completed during Q4, 2020 and is expected to fully validate the flowsheet, process design criteria, and confirm expectations for final concentrate grade and quality. The pilot plant test program (as a key component of Phase 2 Metallurgical test program) is not a requirement of NI43-101 and is being progressed to allow for improved clarity for the concentrate marketing and to proactively progress the future detailed engineering.About the CompanyGen Mining’s focus is the development of the Marathon Palladium Project, the largest undeveloped platinum group metal Mineral Resource in North America. The Marathon property covers a land package of approximately 22,000 hectares, or 220 square kilometres. Gen Mining acquired a 51% interest in the Marathon Project from Sibanye Stillwater on July 10, 2019 and can increase its interest to 80% by spending $10 million over a period of four years. The 80% ownership is expected to be realized later in Q4 2020. As at the end of Q3 2020, approximately $8.7 million of the $10 million has been spent. Sibanye Stillwater has certain back-in rights that allow it to increase its interest in the Marathon Project back up to 51% in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions after such time as Gen Mining has earned its 80% interest (see the Company’s press release of July 11, 2019 for more details).Qualified PersonThe scientific and technical content of this news release was reviewed, verified and approved by Drew Anwyll, P.Eng., M.Eng, Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and a Qualified Person as defined by Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 “Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.”For further information please contact:Jamie Levy   President and Chief Executive   Officer   (416) 640-2934   (416) 567-2440   jlevy@genmining.com  Forward-Looking InformationThis news release includes certain information that may be deemed “forward-looking information” under applicable securities laws.

Earnings and overall profitability continue to be relatively strong, and core deposit growth continued during the quarter at a robust pace.”Third quarter 2020 highlights include:  * Earnings produced a return on average assets of 1.01% for the third quarter of 2020, compared to 0.80% in the previous quarter and 1.43% for the same quarter in the prior year.      * Average deposits grew 4.7% during the quarter and 21.0% over the same quarter of 2019; the cost of deposits decreased to 0.52% in the third quarter, compared to 0.64% in the previous quarter and 1.00% in the same quarter of the prior year.       * Net interest margin was 3.26% for the quarter, up from 3.22% in the second quarter of 2020 and down from 3.75% in the same quarter of the prior year (non-GAAP).       * Noninterest revenues increased $457 thousand, or 11.9%, when compared to the previous quarter, and increased $121 thousand, or 2.9%, compared to the same quarter in the prior year.       * Noninterest expense increased $1.7 million, or 13.7%, when compared to the previous quarter, and increased $348 thousand, or 2.5% when compared to the same quarter in the prior year.       * The third quarter provision for loan losses totaled $2.6 million, which compares to a provision of $4.8 million for the previous quarter, and a recovery of $12 thousand in the same quarter in the prior year. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans held for investment increased to 1.01% at period end. Excluding Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans, the allowance as a percentage of loans increased to 1.16% at period end.      * Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets remained stable at 0.16% at September 30, 2020 and at June 30, 2020, and up from 0.15% at September 30, 2019.      * Annualized net charge-offs were 0.01% for the third quarter of 2020, compared to zero for the corresponding quarter in the prior year and down from 0.06% for the second quarter of 2020.      * During the third quarter of 2020, the Company continued to participate in the Small Business Administration’s PPP under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, which was intended to provide economic relief to small businesses that have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic. The Company had outstanding net PPP loans of $266.0 million at September 30, 2020, which compares to $264.0 million at June 30, 2020. The Company had net unamortized PPP loan origination fees with a balance of $6.8 million at September 30, 2020, which compares to $7.8 million at June 30, 2020.  NET INTEREST INCOMENet interest income for the third quarter of 2020 was $21.5 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 6.1%, from the prior quarter and an increase of $873 thousand, or 4.2%, from the third quarter of 2019. The third quarter of 2020 included $800,000 in cash basis accretion income related to the collection of a purchased loan previously charged off in a prior American National bank acquisition. The fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) net interest margin for the quarter was 3.26%, up from 3.22% in the prior quarter and down from 3.75% in the same period a year ago (non-GAAP). The increase from second quarter was attributable to the increase in cash basis accretion during the period, partially offset by the full quarter impact of lower yielding PPP loans and the continuing effects of a significantly lower rate environment. The decrease from the same quarter in the prior period was attributable to lower yielding PPP loans coupled with a significantly lower rate environment.The Company’s FTE net interest margin includes the impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments. During the third quarter of 2020, net accretion related to acquisition accounting amounted to $861 thousand, compared to $948 thousand for the same period in 2019 and $801 thousand in the prior quarter. Estimated remaining net accretion from acquisitions for the periods indicated is as follows (dollars in thousands):For the remaining three months of 2020 (estimated)$530  For the years ending (estimated):   20211,850  20221,139  2023697  2024367  2025266  Thereafter978    ASSET QUALITYNonperforming assets (“NPAs”) totaled $4.6 million as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, and up from $3.7 million at September 30, 2019. NPAs as a percentage of total assets were 0.16% at September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, compared to 0.15% at September 30, 2019.The provision for loan losses was $2.6 million for the third quarter of 2020, as compared to $4.8 million for the previous quarter and a recovery of $12 thousand for the same period in the previous year. A smaller provision was needed in the third quarter compared to the second as economic factors stabilized; however, the bank continues to see stress in certain industry segments, has an active Disaster Assistance Program, and recorded higher specific reserves during the period. The allowance for loan losses was $21.1 million at September 30, 2020, compared to $18.5 million at June 30, 2020 and $12.8 million at September 30, 2019. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was 0.01% for the third quarter of 2020, compared to 0.06% in the previous quarter and none for the same period in the prior year. The allowance as a percentage of loans held for investment was 1.01% at September 30, 2020, compared to 0.88% at June 30, 2020 and 0.71% at September 30, 2019. Excluding PPP loans, the allowance as a percentage of loans increased to 1.16% at September 30, 2020, compared to 1.01% at June 30, 2020 and 0.71% at September 30, 2019.American National continues to utilize a Disaster Assistance Program during the pandemic for borrowers. At September 30, 2020, American National has provided interest only and payment deferrals to customers with balances amounting to $135.2 million, representing 6.5% of total loans held for investment, which compares to $395 million or 18.8% of outstanding loans held for investment at June 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020, in accordance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act, the Company has granted $15 million in second time payment or interest deferrals, representing less than 1% of total loans held for investment.American National continues to use an incurred loss model for its allowance methodology and has not implemented the new current expected credit losses standard (“CECL”). CECL incorporates an estimation of expected losses over the life of the loans instead of the current model which is an incurred loss model. The CECL implementation guidance was amended in October 2019 allowing for the deferral of CECL for smaller reporting companies. American National qualified under this amendment and elected to defer the implementation until January 2023.NONINTEREST INCOMENoninterest income increased $457 thousand or 11.9% to $4.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 from $3.8 million in the prior quarter and increased $121 thousand or 2.9% from the same period in the prior year. Mortgage banking income was higher by $137 thousand or 15.3% over the prior quarter primarily the result of increased mortgage loan refinance volumes due to the current low interest rate environment. Trust revenues were up $101 thousand or 10.6% over the previous quarter. Income from small business investment companies (&amp;quot;SBICs&amp;quot;) was up $217 thousand or 182.4% over the previous quarter. Comparing the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2019, the increase was reflective of increased mortgage banking income and trust revenues, offset by decreased service charges on deposit accounts and securities gains.NONINTEREST EXPENSENoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2020 amounted to $14.1 million, up $1.7 million, or 13.7%, when compared to the $12.4 million for the previous quarter and up from $13.8 million or 2.5% when compared to the same period in the previous year. The increase from the second quarter of 2020 was a result of the deferral of salary expenses of $1.6 million related to PPP originations in the second quarter. The third quarter of 2019 reflected a small bank credit from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) assessment which accounted for the majority of the change period over period.INCOME TAXESThe effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was 20.0%, compared to 20.6% for the prior quarter and 21.1% for the same period in the prior year.BALANCE SHEETTotal assets at September 30, 2020 were $2.9 billion, an increase of $38.8 million from June 30, 2020 and $448.8 million from the same quarter one year ago. The improvement over the same period a year ago is primarily due to loan growth from the origination of PPP loans and an increase in cash and cash equivalents, partially attributable to the PPP deposits.At September 30, 2020, loans held for investment (net of deferred fees and costs) were $2.1 billion, a decrease of $15.6 million or 3.0% annualized from June 30, 2020. Loans held for investment increased $281.6 million or 15.6%, from June 30, 2019. Excluding PPP loans, loans held for investment were only slightly higher year over year.Deposits amounted to $2.5 billion at September 30, 2020, with growth of $38.9 million or 6.4% annualized from June 30, 2020 and $428.8 million or 21.0% annualized compared to the same quarter of 2019. The growth over the prior quarter and prior period of 2019 relates to the continued growth in new accounts and higher average cash balances. Customers have continued to maintain higher cash balances throughout the second and third quarters of 2020 as future liquidity needs remain uncertain. This buildup of cash reserves primarily accounts for the significant increase over the same period of 2019.The Company continues to be well-capitalized as defined by regulators, with tangible common equity to tangible assets of 8.55% at September 30, 2020 as compared to 8.49% at June 30, 2020 and 9.50% at September 30, 2019.ABOUT AMERICAN NATIONALAmerican National is a multi-state bank holding company with total assets of approximately $2.9 billion.

(NASDAQ: AMNB) (“American National” or the “Company”) today reported third quarter 2020 earnings of $7.2 million, or $0.66 per diluted common share. Those results compare to $8.7 million, or $0.78 per diluted common share, during the same quarter in the prior year, and net income of $5.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted common share, recognized for the second quarter of 2020. Earnings for the first nine months of 2020 were $21.3 million, or $1.93 per diluted common share, compared to $13.5 million, or $1.30 per diluted common share for the same period of 2019. Earnings for the nine months of 2019 were impacted by $11.3 million in merger related expenses.President and Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey V. Haley commented, “We are pleased to report a strong quarter given the continuing challenges our nation and economy face with the pandemic. Capital, liquidity and credit quality all remain strong. Earnings and overall profitability continue to be relatively strong, and core deposit growth continued during the quarter at a robust pace.”Third quarter 2020 highlights include:  * Earnings produced a return on average assets of 1.01% for the third quarter of 2020, compared to 0.80% in the previous quarter and 1.43% for the same quarter in the prior year.      * Average deposits grew 4.7% during the quarter and 21.0% over the same quarter of 2019; the cost of deposits decreased to 0.52% in the third quarter, compared to 0.64% in the previous quarter and 1.00% in the same quarter of the prior year.       * Net interest margin was 3.26% for the quarter, up from 3.22% in the second quarter of 2020 and down from 3.75% in the same quarter of the prior year (non-GAAP).       * Noninterest revenues increased $457 thousand, or 11.9%, when compared to the previous quarter, and increased $121 thousand, or 2.9%, compared to the same quarter in the prior year.       * Noninterest expense increased $1.7 million, or 13.7%, when compared to the previous quarter, and increased $348 thousand, or 2.5% when compared to the same quarter in the prior year.       * The third quarter provision for loan losses totaled $2.6 million, which compares to a provision of $4.8 million for the previous quarter, and a recovery of $12 thousand in the same quarter in the prior year. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans held for investment increased to 1.01% at period end. Excluding Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans, the allowance as a percentage of loans increased to 1.16% at period end.      * Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets remained stable at 0.16% at September 30, 2020 and at June 30, 2020, and up from 0.15% at September 30, 2019.      * Annualized net charge-offs were 0.01% for the third quarter of 2020, compared to zero for the corresponding quarter in the prior year and down from 0.06% for the second quarter of 2020.      * During the third quarter of 2020, the Company continued to participate in the Small Business Administration’s PPP under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, which was intended to provide economic relief to small businesses that have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic. The Company had outstanding net PPP loans of $266.0 million at September 30, 2020, which compares to $264.0 million at June 30, 2020. The Company had net unamortized PPP loan origination fees with a balance of $6.8 million at September 30, 2020, which compares to $7.8 million at June 30, 2020.  NET INTEREST INCOMENet interest income for the third quarter of 2020 was $21.5 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 6.1%, from the prior quarter and an increase of $873 thousand, or 4.2%, from the third quarter of 2019. The third quarter of 2020 included $800,000 in cash basis accretion income related to the collection of a purchased loan previously charged off in a prior American National bank acquisition. The fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) net interest margin for the quarter was 3.26%, up from 3.22% in the prior quarter and down from 3.75% in the same period a year ago (non-GAAP). The increase from second quarter was attributable to the increase in cash basis accretion during the period, partially offset by the full quarter impact of lower yielding PPP loans and the continuing effects of a significantly lower rate environment. The decrease from the same quarter in the prior period was attributable to lower yielding PPP loans coupled with a significantly lower rate environment.The Company’s FTE net interest margin includes the impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments. During the third quarter of 2020, net accretion related to acquisition accounting amounted to $861 thousand, compared to $948 thousand for the same period in 2019 and $801 thousand in the prior quarter. Estimated remaining net accretion from acquisitions for the periods indicated is as follows (dollars in thousands):For the remaining three months of 2020 (estimated)$530  For the years ending (estimated):   20211,850  20221,139  2023697  2024367  2025266  Thereafter978    ASSET QUALITYNonperforming assets (“NPAs”) totaled $4.6 million as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, and up from $3.7 million at September 30, 2019. NPAs as a percentage of total assets were 0.16% at September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, compared to 0.15% at September 30, 2019.The provision for loan losses was $2.6 million for the third quarter of 2020, as compared to $4.8 million for the previous quarter and a recovery of $12 thousand for the same period in the previous year. A smaller provision was needed in the third quarter compared to the second as economic factors stabilized; however, the bank continues to see stress in certain industry segments, has an active Disaster Assistance Program, and recorded higher specific reserves during the period. The allowance for loan losses was $21.1 million at September 30, 2020, compared to $18.5 million at June 30, 2020 and $12.8 million at September 30, 2019. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was 0.01% for the third quarter of 2020, compared to 0.06% in the previous quarter and none for the same period in the prior year. The allowance as a percentage of loans held for investment was 1.01% at September 30, 2020, compared to 0.88% at June 30, 2020 and 0.71% at September 30, 2019. Excluding PPP loans, the allowance as a percentage of loans increased to 1.16% at September 30, 2020, compared to 1.01% at June 30, 2020 and 0.71% at September 30, 2019.American National continues to utilize a Disaster Assistance Program during the pandemic for borrowers. At September 30, 2020, American National has provided interest only and payment deferrals to customers with balances amounting to $135.2 million, representing 6.5% of total loans held for investment, which compares to $395 million or 18.8% of outstanding loans held for investment at June 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020, in accordance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act, the Company has granted $15 million in second time payment or interest deferrals, representing less than 1% of total loans held for investment.American National continues to use an incurred loss model for its allowance methodology and has not implemented the new current expected credit losses standard (“CECL”). CECL incorporates an estimation of expected losses over the life of the loans instead of the current model which is an incurred loss model. The CECL implementation guidance was amended in October 2019 allowing for the deferral of CECL for smaller reporting companies. American National qualified under this amendment and elected to defer the implementation until January 2023.NONINTEREST INCOMENoninterest income increased $457 thousand or 11.9% to $4.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 from $3.8 million in the prior quarter and increased $121 thousand or 2.9% from the same period in the prior year. Mortgage banking income was higher by $137 thousand or 15.3% over the prior quarter primarily the result of increased mortgage loan refinance volumes due to the current low interest rate environment. Trust revenues were up $101 thousand or 10.6% over the previous quarter. Income from small business investment companies (&amp;quot;SBICs&amp;quot;) was up $217 thousand or 182.4% over the previous quarter. Comparing the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2019, the increase was reflective of increased mortgage banking income and trust revenues, offset by decreased service charges on deposit accounts and securities gains.NONINTEREST EXPENSENoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2020 amounted to $14.1 million, up $1.7 million, or 13.7%, when compared to the $12.4 million for the previous quarter and up from $13.8 million or 2.5% when compared to the same period in the previous year. The increase from the second quarter of 2020 was a result of the deferral of salary expenses of $1.6 million related to PPP originations in the second quarter. The third quarter of 2019 reflected a small bank credit from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) assessment which accounted for the majority of the change period over period.INCOME TAXESThe effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was 20.0%, compared to 20.6% for the prior quarter and 21.1% for the same period in the prior year.BALANCE SHEETTotal assets at September 30, 2020 were $2.9 billion, an increase of $38.8 million from June 30, 2020 and $448.8 million from the same quarter one year ago. The improvement over the same period a year ago is primarily due to loan growth from the origination of PPP loans and an increase in cash and cash equivalents, partially attributable to the PPP deposits.At September 30, 2020, loans held for investment (net of deferred fees and costs) were $2.1 billion, a decrease of $15.6 million or 3.0% annualized from June 30, 2020. Loans held for investment increased $281.6 million or 15.6%, from June 30, 2019. Excluding PPP loans, loans held for investment were only slightly higher year over year.Deposits amounted to $2.5 billion at September 30, 2020, with growth of $38.9 million or 6.4% annualized from June 30, 2020 and $428.8 million or 21.0% annualized compared to the same quarter of 2019. The growth over the prior quarter and prior period of 2019 relates to the continued growth in new accounts and higher average cash balances. Customers have continued to maintain higher cash balances throughout the second and third quarters of 2020 as future liquidity needs remain uncertain. This buildup of cash reserves primarily accounts for the significant increase over the same period of 2019.The Company continues to be well-capitalized as defined by regulators, with tangible common equity to tangible assets of 8.55% at September 30, 2020 as compared to 8.49% at June 30, 2020 and 9.50% at September 30, 2019.ABOUT AMERICAN NATIONALAmerican National is a multi-state bank holding company with total assets of approximately $2.9 billion.

(OTCQB: KMPH), a specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of proprietary prodrugs, today announced that research involving KP415 and serdexmethylphenidate (SDX) will be featured in two oral presentations during the Annual American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) 2020 Virtual Meeting. In addition, research conducted by KemPharm’s scientific team related to patterns of abuse of prescription stimulant products will be presented during the poster session.   The two oral presentations will be delivered on October 23, 2020 as part of the “Research Pipeline: New Findings on Diagnostic and Therapeutics” session (2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., ET).  KP415 is KemPharm’s investigational product candidate for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Serdexmethylphenidate (SDX) is KemPharm’s prodrug of d-methylphenidate (d-MPH). KP415 consists of SDX co-formulated with immediate-release d-MPH. A New Drug Application (NDA) for KP415 is currently under review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with an anticipated PDUFA date of March 2, 2021.“We are pleased that three studies involving KP415, the potentially advantageous properties of SDX, and the patterns of abuse of prescription stimulant products were accepted for scientific presentations at the AACAP 2020 Virtual Meeting,” said Travis Mickle, Ph.D., President and CEO of KemPharm. “Having two oral presentations and a poster session during this important scientific gathering demonstrates the amount of scientific interest in the potential for KP415 to address unmet needs for treating patients with ADHD. As the regulatory review of KP415 advances towards an expected March 2, 2021 PDUFA, we believe the research presented at AACAP 2020 provides additional information that will prove beneficial to potential future prescribers, including data affirming the lower abuse potential of SDX and the importance of minimizing such abuse.”The first oral presentation, “Human Abuse Potential Assessment of Serdexmethylphenidate (SDX), A Novel Prodrug of d-Methylphenidate,” examines the human abuse potential of SDX in comparison to standard d-methylphenidate (d-MPH) products when administered by routes commonly reported by stimulant abusers (oral, intranasal and intravenous). To be presented by Lynn Webster, M.D., Vice President of Scientific Affairs at PRA Healthsciences, data from this comprehensive series of studies suggest that SDX may have a lower intrinsic abuse potential than d-MPH HCl when administered via the most common routes of abuse for methylphenidate (MPH) products.The second oral presentation, “Analysis of Growth Velocity in Children Treated for up to 12 Months with KP415, an Investigational ADHD Product Containing the Prodrug Serdexmethylphenidate (SDX),” provides an analysis of the potential effects of KP415 on expected gains in weight and height in children treated for up to 12 months. To be presented by Ann Childress, M.D., President of the Center for Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine, the research examined the body weight and height of children who participated in a Phase 3, long-term, open label safety study of KP415, concluding that, consistent with prior studies of MPH products, long-term treatment with KP415 can lead to modest reductions in expected weight and lower-than-expected increases in height based on individual subject age and sex. However, such deficits relative to children in the general U.S. population diminish or plateau later in treatment.In addition, a poster presentation titled, “Patterns of Abuse of Prescription Stimulant Products from the National Addictions Vigilance Intervention Program (NAVIPPRO®): 2010-2018,” will highlight a study designed to characterize patterns of abuse of prescription stimulants, including MPH products, abuse among adolescents and adults being evaluated for substance abuse treatment. Submitted by Andrew Barrett, Ph.D., KemPharm’s Vice President, Scientific Affairs, data from the study suggests that abuse of prescription MPH products by multiple routes of administration remains prevalent in adolescents and adults and is associated with risky abuse-related behaviors such as injection drug use.About KemPharm:KemPharm is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of proprietary prodrugs to treat serious medical conditions through its proprietary LAT® (Ligand Activated Therapy) technology. KemPharm utilizes its proprietary LAT® technology to generate improved prodrug versions of FDA-approved drugs as well as to generate prodrug versions of existing compounds that may have applications for new disease indications.

To be presented by Lynn Webster, M.D., Vice President of Scientific Affairs at PRA Healthsciences, data from this comprehensive series of studies suggest that SDX may have a lower intrinsic abuse potential than d-MPH HCl when administered via the most common routes of abuse for methylphenidate (MPH) products.The second oral presentation, “Analysis of Growth Velocity in Children Treated for up to 12 Months with KP415, an Investigational ADHD Product Containing the Prodrug Serdexmethylphenidate (SDX),” provides an analysis of the potential effects of KP415 on expected gains in weight and height in children treated for up to 12 months. To be presented by Ann Childress, M.D., President of the Center for Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine, the research examined the body weight and height of children who participated in a Phase 3, long-term, open label safety study of KP415, concluding that, consistent with prior studies of MPH products, long-term treatment with KP415 can lead to modest reductions in expected weight and lower-than-expected increases in height based on individual subject age and sex. However, such deficits relative to children in the general U.S. population diminish or plateau later in treatment.In addition, a poster presentation titled, “Patterns of Abuse of Prescription Stimulant Products from the National Addictions Vigilance Intervention Program (NAVIPPRO®): 2010-2018,” will highlight a study designed to characterize patterns of abuse of prescription stimulants, including MPH products, abuse among adolescents and adults being evaluated for substance abuse treatment. Submitted by Andrew Barrett, Ph.D., KemPharm’s Vice President, Scientific Affairs, data from the study suggests that abuse of prescription MPH products by multiple routes of administration remains prevalent in adolescents and adults and is associated with risky abuse-related behaviors such as injection drug use.About KemPharm:KemPharm is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of proprietary prodrugs to treat serious medical conditions through its proprietary LAT® (Ligand Activated Therapy) technology. KemPharm utilizes its proprietary LAT® technology to generate improved prodrug versions of FDA-approved drugs as well as to generate prodrug versions of existing compounds that may have applications for new disease indications.
